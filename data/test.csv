 """"UN does not recognize"""" is the most ridiculous thing to write here. Are you people serious? UNSC could not agree. That is a FACT!!! 
 If there was no Veto mechanism it would have been 3:2 for recognition, but since there is one: it is undecided. On the other hand 
 the recognition was not even discussed since Russia always threatened with the use of VETO. Therefore it was never laid out in front of the SC. 
 To whoever put it (avala?) - take it off and spare us the time. Do your homework. This is not a football match!!! 
 To the rest of you, please do not use bold text to emphasize things. I am sure everyone can read. 
 The same thing applies to EU. Remove the bold NOT recognize. We can all do the math and by now it is clear that 20 countries will recognize it. 
 So what's the point of bold NOT RECOGNIZE and then putting all these EU flags next to the countries which did recognize. Besides EU could also not agree so they let it up to each country to decide. 
 but using bold is a nasty useless trick, It is the same kind of a trick that is used by avala to manipulate the Armenian statement """"ARMENIA DOES NOT RECOGNIZE"""" yet.

 Basmati (, , ,) is a variety of long grain rice, notable for its fragrance and delicate flavour. Its name means """"the fragrant one"""" in Sanskrit, but it can also mean """"the soft rice."""" Pakistan and India are the largest cultivators and exporters of this rice; it is primarily grown through paddy field farming in the Punjab region. 

 The grains of basmati rice are longer than most other types of rice. Cooked grains of Basmati rice are characteristically free flowing rather than sticky, as with most long-grain rice. Cooked basmati rice can be uniquely identified by its fragrance. Basmati rice is available in two varieties - white and brown. 

 == Flavour == 

 Basmati rice has a typical pandan-like (Pandanus amaryllifolius leaf) flavour caused by the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. 

 == Varieties and hybrids == 

 A number of varieties of basmati rice exist. Traditional types include Basmati-370, Basmati-385 and Basmati-Ranbirsinghpura(R.S.Pura), while hybrid basmati varieties include Pusa Basmati 1 (also called 'Todal', because the flower has awns). Fragrant rices that are derived from basmati stock but are not considered true basmati varieties include PB2 (also called sugandh-2), PB3 and RH-10. 

 Scientists at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Delhi took the traditional basmati and genetically modified it to produce a hybrid which had most of the good features of traditional basmati (grain elongation, fragrance, alkali content) and the plant was a semi-dwarf type. This basmati was called Pusa Basmati-1. PB1 crop yield is higher than the traditional varieties (up to twice as much). 

 === List of approved varieties === 

 Punjab, Kernel Basmati (Pakistan), Dehradun, Haryana, Super basmati, Kasturi(Baran,Rajasthan), Basmati 198, basmati 217, basmati 370, basmati 385, basmati 386,   Bihar, Kasturi, Mahi Suganda, Pusa, Ranbir, Taraori. Some non-traditional aromatic crosses with basmati characteristics are marketed under a Sugandh designation. 

 == Detection of adulterated strains == 

 Difficulty in differentiating genuine traditional basmati from pretenders and the significant price difference between them has led fraudulent traders to adulterate traditional basmati. To protect the interests of consumers and trade, a PCR-based assay similar to DNA fingerprinting in humans allows for the detection of adulterated and non-basmati strains. Its detection limit for adulteration is from 1% upwards with an error rate of ±1.5%. Exporters of basmati rice use 'purity certificates' based on DNA tests for their basmati rice consignments. See Protocol  and . Based on this protocol, which was developed at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Labindia, an Indian company has released kits to detect basmati adulteration.

 == I am retiring from WP, but please apologize for the false allegation of personal attack, I have evidence refuting it == 

 I have decided to retire from Wikipedia because of administrators' mishandling of the report I put in, in which I took most of the blame for accusations that are false. Drmies, you accused be of personal attack after I stated to Lihaas that I had nothing in common with him because of his stated association with fascism and National Socialism that I refer to as """"Nazism"""" as it is on Wikipedia. Now you and others claim that maybe he is misrepresenting himself - that he meant to say that he is a """"democratic nationalist socialist"""" - - first of all he states on his user page that he is a fascist - and bear in mind that National Socialism as on Wikipedia and in many scholarly works is recognized as a form of fascism. If there is any question as to whether I falsely claimed he was a fascist and Nazi (in the sense of the broader """"National Socialism"""") - look at this userbox on his page: 

  
 The infoboxes repeatedly state """"National Socialist"""" as """"NS"""" on multiple infoboxes. He also has other infoboxes that support far-right ultranationalist political parties- that indicate even further that he is aligned with fascism and National Socialism (as in Nazism), such as: 
  - Jobbik is a far right Hungarian ultranationalist movement with a paramilitary movement called Magyar Gárda (Hungarian Guard) - it is anti-Semitic - it accuses Israel of """"buying up"""" Hungary and its paramilitary group attacks Romani (Gypsy) people. 

  - Ataka - Greek short form for National Union Attack - far-right Bulgarian nationalist movement - acknowledged by all parliamentary parties as a xenophobic movement and a national threat to Bulgaria's ethnic minorities, it known for hate speech, the Ataka's leader's son sent an anti-Romani email to members of the European Parliament - sniding that Hungary is """"full"""" of Romani. 
  L.A.O.S. short form for Popular Orthodox Rally - a far-right Greek nationalist movement - it opposes any immigration from outside the European Union 
 
 True, he has contradictory userboxes - it may mean he is politically confused or has mixed opinions. Bottom line, from the statements of his userboxes, he is not merely a nationalistic socialist, his userboxes make clear that he is a fascist National Socialist and that he supports multiple far-right ultranationalist political parties - two of which have promoted xenophobia towards ethnic minorities - Jobbik towards Jews and Romani, and Ataka towards Romani. When Lihaas started confronting me, I stated on Lihaas' userpage that I fundamentally opposed his views and do not want to associate with him or talk with him because of those views - that is my choice and my right not to be forced to accept unwanted postings on my talk page. I don't care whether he wants to keep them or not, I think he has the right of personal liberty to post his political views - but he should not expect everyone to respect his stated support of fascism, National Socialism, and far-right ultranationalist movements - as I said, I do not want to talk with a person who adheres to such views.  

 I am preparing my final retirement from Wikipedia so please respond here, but I want an apology for administrators' mishandling of this, I was honest and stating what he himself posted on his user page when I said he was a fascist and a Nazi, his userpage says that he """"is a Fascist"""" and that he """"is a National Socialist"""" and his support of Jobbik and other far-right ultranationalist parties - just put those together in your mind and take note where the term National Socialism redirects to on Wikipedia: Nazism - and I referred to Nazism in its general form of an ideology and its continuation in a general form as neo-Nazism. Lihaas may claim that he does not support German Nazism, but when I first noticed these tendencies on his talk page - I noticed the anti-Romani, anti-Semitic Jobbik movement first of all, then looked on and saw the other two infoboxes I mentioned - all the same - I do not want to talk with someone who supports far-right ultranationalist movements that promote xenophobia - that is my choice not to talk to the person and my right not to have the person talk to me after I have told them not to.

I'll break this down so you can understand. Disjunction means to break a connection; was the KMT connected to Taiwan at the time? Yes. Legal or not, a definite political connection existed (i.e. the KMT was in charge). Was the KMT a larger political unit? At the time, yes, since they still occupied the mainland. Did the insurgents want to break Taiwan's existing connection with the KMT? Yes. Therefore, the insurgents were separatists. And, therefore, your arguments involving Taiwan's legal status (or, basically, all your posts since the very beginning of the discussion) are irrelevant.

 If you go frame by frame when the name is said at the end it was cut to the frame ending in """"y"""" when he said Kasey's name.  If he was saying Kasey your safe there would have been a pause to cut into between Kasey and your.  If it was a twist ending then there would have still been a pause between Kasey and your as in Kasey your going home or Kasey your safe.   

 I think they frame cut on the """"y"""" because there would not be a frame pause in between when saying Kasey and Jake.  No one pauses when saying and in a situation like that.  Also notice that the announcer emphasizes the clarification """"if you don't hear your name your leaving immediately.""""

All they would talk about was perverted things! So, research ended up with the conclusion that Grish = Perverted. Yet, it wasn't the end of things. Grish was quite stupid talking about every little detail! And you know what they say, Perverted = Sex. As kids learn in Geometry, the 'transitive property', researchers used it to find out what the word Grish meant.

 == Economizer's new edits == 

 quoting yoru new section “This contrasts with the subjective theory of value as an explanation for differing prices of goods, which says that value is determined by a good's ability to satisfy a want and its scarcity.” Ricardo himself discusses this verry topic (scarcity and desire in shaping exchange-value) in the his “Principles”. So again you're erecting a strawman artilce so that you can contrast it with your original research (which is only original in that it plagarizes Ricardo and then uses him as the strawman against which your article is contrasted).   
 :I noted that Ricardo found exceptions to his labor theory of value. But, he did not abandon it in favor of the subjective theory. The labor theory clearly cannot explain exchange value, the adherents to the labor theory tried for a long time. By the way, now you're getting nasty again, by claiming I'm plagiarizing Ricardo.   

 :: We're not talking about exceptions to his labor theory of value. We're talking about his theory of exchange-value where he always sees exchange-value influenced by value along with scarcity and desire for a commodity. He doesn't use the term LTV nor does he use the term subjectivist, because those terms are contemporary terms. But the contrast you make is completely contrived. You provide no supporting evidence from Ricardo that supports anything you say about his theory of exchange-value. BTW, are you saying that for the subjectivist theory, production conditions do not effect exchange-value. Because then I could see the contrast. But you should probably just contrast it with contemporary neoclassical economic theory that more people are familiar with, because neoclassical theory (like Ricardo) holds that both production conditions and scracity effect exchange-value. And you've gotten nasty by claiming an article that carfeully cites sources is original research while working on an article that cites no sources whatsoever (the subjectivist theory of value)   

 :::Saying that I think you're engaging in """"original research"""" is not accusing you of doing anything malicious or dishonest. It just means that I think you're drawing your own conclusions from things instead of referencing sources that draw those conclusions. I could be right or I could be wrong. Your statements may be referenceble or they may not be. If they're not referenceable than they shouldn't be here. I don't doubt that you're doing your honest best to try to interpret correctly. Don't accuse me of """"plagiarizing."""" Plagiarizing means taking someone's words and claiming them as my own. If you think the subjective theory of value article is original research, then by all means put some tags up so we can verify things. This is how Wikipedia articles are improved. Please work with the process. Above all, don't think that the article will ever be stable even if a consensus is reached, because new people are always coming in and a new consensus has to be reached. If you worked on the ariticle before and got it the way you wanted it, great. But everything in this article will be erased and redone in another way over and over and over. It's very sysiphian. I look it more as a learning experience than anything else. If all my work is destroyed in time, and it will just as yours will, I really don't care.   

 :::: It's not my work per se that I'm trying to proect. I understand how wikipedia works. However, this article and many artciles related to this are subject to very hoaky edits like the ones you've been trying to make. People want the LTV to be a certain strawman theory so that they can knowck it down. They  have countless obsscure authors no one haw ever heard of to cite. Or they cite reputable suthors but construe them in ways that are entirely unsupportable (your quotation of the very first heading in Ricardo's ‘Principles’ comes to mind). Besides that heading, there's very little in the chapter that supports the ridiculous strawman position you accuse Ricardo of. The whole thing degrades the Wiki experience (for editors/contributors and readers alike). So I don't care much that my work is sacred or that my prose should not be touched. But this is an article I care to see held to decent academic standards. Whereas many people (who think the LTV is anacrhonistic) want to the article to serve some auxillary purpose. 

 :::: So I welcome honest contributions from those who've read primary and secondary sources on the LTV. And I welcome contributions to the criticism section from those critical of the theory (those I'm less familiar with).

 But the balance he arrives at, much depends on the choice and presentation of sources, and the weighting given them. In other words Powers has given himself full freedom as to where he will find his balance: and that balance of course just happens to lie inside his comfort space as a believer in TB....  

 As an example: for Powers presents Goldsteins view of the DL as being a """"devious but inept politician"""" who exasperates the Chinese with """"duplicity, intransigence and bungling"""". Now Goldstein thinks the DL made strategic mistakes in his relations with the Chinese, but has a much more qualified view, and never uses that sort of language. So Powers has used the """"straw man"""" technique by presenting a view and language not used by Goldstein, and attacking that to provide evidence of bias.

The number of citations is so many that there is really no doubt about the validity of Einstein's theory, and his own work is directly read, instead of reading later citations of his work. Furthermore, if a text is used as a textbook in a world-class university at a graduate level, (which is clearly listed as a valid reliable source on [this page|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Reliable_sources]) then I don't see why one wouldn't cite the work itself. In any case, as you can see below, it is not that I cannot cite peer-reviewed journal papers. But I strongly feel that citing them on a religious matter is empty - it doesn't indicate that the people actually practicing the religion really believe what these academics are writing in Journals. Hence I hold the view that peer-reviewed Journal publications would NOT be as reliable as the those practicing the religion itself. If this were an article about the culture of the country, or the history of the religion, I would concede fully that peer-reviewed academic Journal papers would weigh more than a religious person, because out of enthusiasm for their own religion, a religious person might make tall claims about its history. But when it comes to understanding a matter of religious doctrine, the people of the religion themselves matter more, because they are less likely to misrepresent the actual religion - obviously they want their religion to be well-understood by others. But academics writing about a religious doctrine are less likely to spend the time required to fully grasp a doctrine and may do a superficial analysis.

 Hi J. Vinther, i am going to give you some unsolicited advice. According to the bold-revert-discuss cycle, when your addition is challenged, you should not re-insert it but rather immediately go to the talk page to discuss. This helps prevent edit wars. Edit warring is when an editor repeatedly inserts an edit in spite of the objections of other editors, and it's something for which you can be blocked. On a more personal note, it's not a good idea to assume that people think all your contributions are useless; we don't think that at all. Threatening to quit when you don't get your way is also frowned upon. You wouldn't use that self-deprecatory tone in the workplace and you shouldn't use it here either; it's not the way to earn anyone's respect.

 I make the above surmise not to be contentious, but because it bears on an ongoing problem I have while writing biographies on World War I flying aces.

Also, the alleged false statement was the Durning was the 2nd most decorated soldier of WWII, which Monkeyzpop disputes. If such a trivial thing deserves mention (which IMO it doesn't), then you would need to provide a reference that someone else is the 2nd most decorated soldier of WWII.

 The basic concept is that you cannot owe a debt to yourself. The Fed cannot owe a debt to itself.
