 Hi 

Dear Mr. 147.252.223.38.

Please do not vandalize like you did to Fourier inversion formula. Math is a wonderful subject even if you don't appreciate it. Mathematicians do something useful for the world and what they do lasts for centuries. They also enjoy what they do. If, by """"get a life"""", you mean """"go to parties, get drunk, and crash your car into another car and die"""", then it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence that mathematics is far superior.

Also, you have no right to criticize people who do math unless you yourself can understand what they do. The mathematics you have criticized is deep and interesting and you shouldn't insult it unless you understand it. I hate the mentality that if you don't understand something you need to criticize it. It tells more about you than it does about the people who do math.

Good luck.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Allstarecho is correct in what he says. There is no reference to male-male sexual relationships in the section: Personal relationships. Here is what it currently says, in it's entirety: 
James's personal relationships included relationships with his male courtiers and his marriage to Anne of Denmark, with whom he fathered his children. Growing up, James did not have any parents, for his father, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was murdered and his mother, Mary I of Scotland was forced to flee when she married the suspected murderer, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. His grandfather was assassinated during his boyhood, and he had no siblings.[103][104]
Someone reading the article as it is now would have no idea that there is any debate about James's sexuality. The word """"relationships"""" could mean anything, depending. I also agree with Carcharoth that the current concepts of gay and homosexual are quite different from Jacobean England's, as are concepts of male bonding, friendship, and what's acceptable in society across most cultures and time periods. However, there are reliable sources that say James had sexual relationships with at least some of his male associates. Call it what you will, but excising that from the main article section is not fair. Don't use modern terms if that is the issue. Also, the section should be in rough proportion to the other summary sections in this article, and several of them are approx 230 to 330 words long. Footnote #24 is 117 words. I would agree to move the footnote up to that section and integrate it, including the assertion that it is murky, and debated.  Even if that section is shorter, as long as it gives readers the idea that there is debate about James's sexuality. Then work on the daughter article per the suggestion. That seems fair and balanced, something that I wish to work toward. But to excise mention of anything other than platonic/family relations from the main article is not. Sorry, but footnotes don't count. People just don't generally read them. —   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down or destroyed. Furthermore, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region who took refuge in the Republic of Albania.

The classification list at the top insinuates that all mice belong to the genus Mus, but there are many genera of mice. Chaetodipus, Zapus, Napaeozapus, Onychomys, Baiomys, Ochrotomys, Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, Oryzomys, Liomys, Micrdipodops and Perognathus all live in the United States alone (Whitaker 1991).  I couldn't even guess how many genera there must be in total. Mus only accounts for a miniscule portion of the richness and diversity of the animals we call mice. It should be noted as well that mice are a polyphyletic grouping since some mice are more related to some rats, for instance than they are to other mice.

I am currently writing to you from my place of work, located in Boston, Mass, USA.  I have chosen to perform this unorthodox experiment from my workplace, in order to avoid negative votes on my possible upcoming election as an administrator, on the Wikipedia username I use from home.

TABI appreciate how you all quickly reverted vandalism and left welcoming warning messages in the beginning.  When I continued to vandalize “Wolf” I appreciated how you all “Assumed Good Faith.”  However, Kim van der Linde, at times you forgot to stay “As cool as a cucumber.”  I especially admired Radio Kirk’s reaction and cool persistence with the block he initiated.  His direct quoting of the complaints of others was a smart move.  I also liked how you all continually to welcome me to Wikipedia even though I was annoying the ^&%$ out of you.

I am sure your mother is very proud of your Wikipedia J.D. law degree, but you are not getting any more of my time to contribute to your project and correct your obvious falsehoods and text that does not clearly appear to have been written by an English speaker familiar with Heidegger and able to name even a few of his main concepts. Please point me to the place in the article where even one of H's primary philosophical concepts are reasonably explained, so that a reader may have any idea of what he is after. The current page leaves everyone less intelligent and knowledgeable than they were before reading it. I promise you, that you are not getting even one minute more of my time in any event.  This article is so bad that it needs to be gone through paragraph by paragraphy and replaced my new content. Nearly every paragraph in it leaves the reader knowing less true things about Heidegger than the reader knew before. If you would like to actually know something about Heidegger, read the article I wrote. I managed to explain in the lead the main ideas which one needs to know about Heidegger. The current article does not even succesfully explain Heidegger's thought or his importance within the entire article, and inculcates a number of gross and vulgar misconceptions. It would be almost impossible to imagine a philosophy article that was filled with more sophmoric drivel, and reads like a machine-translated text of an undergraduate who has never read the author, and wishes to spread as much misinformation as possible. If you prefer reading an article that seems to claim that Heidegger has only been read in France and is unable to successfully name or explain EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF HEIDEGGER'S CONCEPTS, please by all means, waste your time on doing so.

A series of publications has focused on the effects of exposure to low frequency (<500 Hz) high intensity (>90 dB) noise, a range of structural lung changes having been reported mainly in rats12 but also in humans.13 These data suggest that low frequency high intensity noise may lead to structural and functional changes in the airways, pleural mesothelium, and lung parenchyma. With frequencies from commercial loud speakers typically in the range of 30 Hz to 20 kHz, it is the lower frequency band of 30–150 Hz which is usually boosted in big music venues for enhanced effect. These low frequencies could indeed be particularly damaging to the lung parenchyma if they coincide with its natural frequency of around 128 Hz.14 Furthermore, Mahagnah and Gavriely15 showed that, in normal humans, the lung acts as a low pass filter with flat transmitted energy up to 100 Hz or 300 Hz. In view of these experimental results, the most compelling observation in our four patients is that the lower frequency band, which tends to be boosted in the kind of music they listen to, corresponds with those frequencies, thereby ensuring maximal acoustic energy transfer to the lungs.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And what do """"quanta"""" and """"cosmology"""" have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as """"the study of everything"""" is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain """"bulk"""" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.

Censoring All Dissent: Does Censorship = Science?

How come there is no criticism of Newton's theory of gravitation on the page?  Afraid of criticism and dissent?  Is Wikipedia afraid of Neutral Points of View or not?

""""Einstein’s theory of gravity is the craziest explanation of the phenomenon imaginable.""""  Wallace Thornhill, physicist, 2001

""""Leibniz also disagreed with other aspects of Newtonianism, such as the use of gravity, which he held to be a revival of occultism, and Newton's use of space as an absolute. Leibnizian physics defined motion and therefore space as relational.""""  William E. Burns, historian, 2001

""""Leibniz held that the Newtonian universe was imperfect because it occasionally requires God to intervene to prevent it from running down.""""  William E. Burns, historian, 2001

""""Leibniz also attacked Newtonian physical ideas, including absolute space and time, [and] the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which he charged introduced an occult force....""""  William E. Burns, historian, 2001

""""Like Huygens, Leibniz never accepted Newtonian gravitation.""""  Ezio Vailati, philosopher, 1997

""""Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians.""""  John M. Keynes, economist, 1936

""""An atom differs from the solar system by the fact that it is not gravitation that makes the electrons go round the nucleus, but electricity.""""  Bertrand Russell, physicist/philosopher, 1924

""""...what is really wanted for a truly Natural Philosophy is a supplement to Newtonian mechanics, expressed in terms of the medium which he suspected and sought after but could not attain, and introducing the additional facts, chiefly electrical—especially the fact of variable inertia—discovered since his time…""""  Oliver J. Lodge, physicst, February 1921

""""Magnetism is possessed by the whole mass of the earth and universe of heavenly bodies, and is an essence of known demonstration and laws. By adopting it we have the advantage over the gravity theory by the use of the polar relation to magnetism. A magnetic north pole presented to a magnetic south pole, or a south pole to a north pole, attracts, while a north pole to another north pole or a south pole to another repels. This gives to us a better reason than gravitation can for the elliptical orbit of the planets instead of the circular. It also gives us some light on the mystery of the tides, the philosophy of which the profoundest study has not solved. Certain facts are apparent; but for the explanation of the true theory such men as Laplace and Newton, and others more recent, have labored in vain.""""  C.H. Kilmer, historian, October 1915

""""Since Newton announced his universal law of gravitation, scientists have accepted and educators taught it, and rarely has it been questioned. Occasionally one has the temerity to say that gravitation is a myth, an invented word to cover scientific ignorance.""""  C.H. Kilmer, historian, October 1915

""""What we call mass would seem to be nothing but an appearance, and all inertia to be of electromagnetic origin.""""  Henri Poincaré, physicist, 1908

""""...the great truth, accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed, is fully recognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball....""""  Nikola Tesla, physicist, 1904

""""If we were to assert that we knew more of moving objects than this their last-mentioned, experimentally-given comportment with respect to the celestial bodies, we should render ourselves culpable of a falsity.""""  Ernst Mach, physicist, 1893

""""...certain theoretical investigations ... appear to me to throw doubt on the utility of very minute gravitational observations.""""  George H. Darwin, physicist, 1882

""""The long and constant persuasion that all the forces of nature are mutually dependent, having one common origin, or rather being different manifestations of one fundamental power, has often made me think on the possibility of establishing, by experiment, a connection between gravity and electricity …no terms could exaggerate the value of the relation they would establish.''  Michael Faraday, physicist, 1865

RJ, I can see why you'd like a legitimate source like that for a photo for the same reason that we require information be verified by RSs in the text. However, the problem I'm seeing is that it strikes me as simply not feasible. If a photo appears from a reliable source, that photo is going to be copyrighted by that reliable source. There's no way we could claim fair use in that situation. In my experience, almost all non-fair use images are either user-generated, taken from a Flickr (or something similar), or have had their copyright expire. If we limit images to those from reliable sources, we pretty much limit ourselves to only fair use images and images of historical subjects. I think that is simply unreasonable. User-generated images and images released under a free license have a role to play on Wikipedia. I think it is up to us as editors to determine that role. In the examples I gave above, do you find it inappropriate that the articles use images with unclear provenance and/or that are not reliably sourced? If not, why not? My point here is that the question """"Says who?"""" could be asked of pretty much any user-generated image or image taken from Flickr, and I don't see why this article is being held to a different standard.
And I haven't tried very hard to argue for its inclusion because I don't think it's that great of a picture. I just disagree with the grounds on which it is being excluded, namely that we need some form of legitimization for the image. I agree that we should have some method to determine whether or not this photo (or any) accurately represents the subject. I don't think we need to get the photo from an RS to do that because I think that places far too high a burden. I think it is up to us, the editors, to determine whether an image adequately represents the subject. Do I think relying on someone else to say, """"Hey this is me being a hipster"""" is sufficient? Of course not. I, personally, judge the photo based on my own knowledge of hipster aesthetic, and the ironic mustache and flannel shirt are enough for me. While neither of those elements is mentioned in the article, I don't think it should be too hard to find an RS or two that mentions them in connection with hipsters.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

d2b1069422d072c4,"Introductory Paragraphs
The intro paragraphs are good, but they could be a lot better.  I think that right now there's too much of a technical sound to it, as opposed to something more educational and inviting to people trying to learn about the subject.  I'd just like you to compare/contrast with the following paragraph, which is how evolution is introduced in a Bio101 textbook:

(Fair use excerpts follows)
Evolution originated with Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species...He argued from evidence that the species of organisms inhabiting Earth today descended from ancestral species.  Second, he proposed a mechanism for evolution which he termed natural selection, the idea that organisms can change over the generations if individuals having certain heritable traits leave more offspring than other individuals.  ..In modern terms, we would say that the genetic composition of the population had changed over time, and that is one way of defining evolution.  But we can also use the termin evolution on a much grander scale to mean all of the biological history, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms.

An understanding of evolution informs every field of biology, and applications of evolutionary biology are transforming medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and conservation...Evolution integrates all of biology.
(above is for example purposes onlywe can't use this in the article.)

We can't use the above since it would be fair-use, but do you see what I mean about making the article more accessible?

Another thing I'd note about the above example is that it also makes Evolution sound more exciting.  Just because we are an encyclopedia doesn't mean we can't put the subject in the exciting, important context that it deserves.

We could use something closer to the above, and then dive into a description of how the Theory of Evolution (what you might call a description of the fact of evolution that's described above) has developed from Darwin's original theory to modern-day explanations (and at the same time state how the question of whether evolution occurs has been a relatively incontroversial fact amongst biologists for the better part of a century).",0,0,0,0,0,0

 biography of Lazar Kaganovich 

a Nice read from a fascinating book for those who deny Kaganovich is one of the worst mass murderers in history and edit it my post defending him. Maybe some information can be added to the page?

Lazar Kaganovich, one of the bloodiest of the communist butchers during the 1930s and 1940s and the number-two man in the Kremlin for many years. 

The book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.

To sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.

In 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of """"wet affairs,"""" with """"wet"""" meaning """"bloody."""" That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.

When the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. """"Your hands are blood-stained too,"""" Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.

As I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself. 

Kaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.

 However, I find this discussion interesting as (according to my personal experience) Stockholm with its 'isolated' location in the middle of Sweden rarely relates itself to Denmark or Copenhagen (we don't hear more from Denmark than do people in, say, London, Paris, or Berlin).  In contrast, Danes (always near Sweden) tend to bother much more about its northern neighbour.  Of historical reasons, Finns tend to behave similarly (regarding Sweden).  It might be interesting for the article (maybe the culture section?) to explain this - after all, Stockholm's only official raison d'être is to be the capital of Sweden, but, locally, there is sort of a subculture trying to develop an identity independent from this.  For example, Stockholm tend to be obsessed by its own local history (sv:Stockholmiana) and one of the most striking thing that occur to tourists must be the historical pretensions of the city, notwithstanding most façades (with their beige plaster) are in fact much younger than buildings in an average European city.  Its symptomatic the new Moderna Museet was well-received in Stockholm because it merged with the neighbourhood whilst a new museum in Copenhagen is celebrated if it gets international attention (i.e. Arken).

8306db99315a531a,"Separation of personal life from main 'eras' section 
The separation of Michael's personal life info from the main 'eras' section is going too far with this categorization thing which seems to have swept up the article recently. Introducing an 'influence' section was alright, as that didn't take from the main body, the chronological section, of the article. But taking out things deemed 'personal' and plonking them neatly under four different areas just doesn't flow well. It junts the reader in and out of various years, and just doesn't work. Before, the article was chronological, and a certain degree of chronology is good in a biographical article. Let me clear up one thing: the eras don't just mean what was related to the ALBUM of the era. The eras are simply a convenient way of splitting up Michael's life into nice sections. We don't need to FURTHER split the article up. I think that we should put personal stuff back into the main chronological bit, as people seem to have misinterpreted what the 'eras' are meant to be. His career and his personal life should go together. For example, the Oprah Interview, once aired, significantly increased sales of Dangerous. That link cannot be neatly established if the two 'bits' (for lack of a better word) are separated. I am trying to reach a new consensus to have the personal stuff put back into the main body, as right not the article seems to be a skeleton of subheadings. The eras are tiny, and any reader will be confused by the layout, which isn't chronological. So that's why I'm trying to reach a new consensus: To put the personal life information back into the chronological part of the article.",0,0,0,0,0,0

following is a repaste of last complete version...

The guineafowl are a family of birds in the same order as the pheasants, turkeys and other game birds. They are also widely known as guineahens, (a term formerly applied to the turkey).

This is an African family of insect and seed-eating, ground-nesting birds resembling partridges, but with featherless heads and spangled grey plumage. The Helmeted Guineafowl has been domesticated and introduced outside its natural range, for example in southern France and the West Indies. 

Guineas are monogamous, spending their lives with the same mate. They lay 25-30 eggs in a deep, tapering nest. Their eggs are small, and dark. The hens have a habit of hiding their nests, and sharing it with others until large numbers of eggs have accumulated. The incubation period is 26-28 days, and the babies are called """"keets."""" They are highly susceptible to dampness (after all, they come from drier areas of Africa) and can die from following the mother through dewy grass. Though, after their first two weeks, they can be some of the hardiest domestic land fowl. 

Sexing the birds is not as simple as telling a rooster from a hen chicken. When they are adults, the helmet and wattles of the male are larger then the female, and the female is the only one to make the two-note cry """"Buck-wheat!"""" Aside from that, however, the two sexes are mostly identical in appearance. 

As domestics, guineas are valuable pest controllers, delighting in ridding your yard and garden of insects. They are especially beneficial in controlling the lyme disease carrying deer tick, as well as annoying wasp nests. While they are rarely kept in large numbers, a few are sometimes kept with other fowl to be used as a security system against hawks. No intruder or stranger will get past the eye of a guinea, and they will call, loudly, with their high shrieking voices. They are highly social birds, and hate to be alone. 

Within the domesticated species, many color variations have been created aside from the """"pearl"""" or natural color of the helmeted guinea. These include White, purple, slate, chocolate, lavander, and coral blue.

The story of C++ Builder, Delphi and RAD Studio is very similar to the story of Visual C++, Visual Basic and Visual Studio. (In fact, I suspect they may be cause and effect.) Once upon a time, when Borland was in charge of development, it only developed C++ Builder and Delphi, two separate but highly compatible development tools. They were two language-specific IDEs. I am not sure who came up with the idea of RAD Studio; CodeGear or Embarcadero. But RAD Studio is like Visual Studio today. RAD Studio supports both C++ Builder and Delphi languages. Buying RAD Studio is like buying both Delphi and C++ Builder. Only buying the two separately costs €11,937.60, while buying only RAD Studio costs €6,715.20. These prices, of course, do not include subscription costs.

The Battle of Tulifinny 
The date is December 9, 1864, and the place is Tulifinny Creek. Citadel cadets joined with cadets from their sister academy, the Arsenal in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. This was different from the Cadet Company. They had been ordered to protect the Tulifinny trestle of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. The mural depicts the cadets repulsing the attack. North Reference Room

Primary Source listed along with info below:

""""Before long, firing sounded in Charlestonthe shots that were to blast in pieces this tenurial Southern existence. Grimmer and blacker for the South, the war years rolled slowly on. And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. 
Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. 
Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. 
With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. """"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,"""" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. 
An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, """"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses."""" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Calling for a movement to eliminate Biritsh spelling on wikipedia 

This is a very serious issue that needs to be confronted. It is not professional, non-NPOV, and inconsistent that we have some articles with British spelling, and others without. There are even some articles that deal with something thats exclusively American, such as the White House for example, that have some words spelled the British way. This should not be, and there should be some uniformity if we wish to have a professional and reliable encyclopedia.

Britian is the only English-speaking country that uses their own unique variation of the English language, and in British contexts, that's usually fine. But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds, and that should be the standard that Wikipedia uses. It makes absolutely no sense to use one country's variation of dialect, no matter how BIG, important, or """"popular"""" it is, and completely disregard the rest of the English-speaking world's orrect usage of the language. 

In fact, pretty much every article that contains a word that differs between the two dialects, the British version is favored. This, also, makes absolutely no sense. If the majority of a population speaks and/or writes a certain way, then it's institutions, endorsements, and websites should speak/write that certain way, too. It is understandable if this website was: www.wikpedia.co.uk, because that assumes that this is a primarily UK website. But, this website is: www.wikipedia.com, so it should follow the standard dialect that other """".com"""" use. 

This isn't in any way some sort of hate movement or opinion. This is an encyclopedia, and in encyclopedias, information must be consistent and reliable. Please take your time to think about this issue, for the uniformity of this encyclopedia will help ensure that the current and future quality standards will be upheld.

Taking this hypothetical Shakespeare scenario, it would tell us about his writing process, and perhaps a little of the politics of theatre in his era. Was it delayed because of writer's block? Were elements of the play changed from the way he envisaged/first drew it out because of that? How did it change the theme, climax, or emotion of the show? Was it delayed because the people in power (ie. the theatre owners) disagreed with the play he had created (imagine their reaction if it centred around a homosexual relationship back in that day!)? Or was it perhaps the actors who disagreed with the roles they had to take on? Again that leads us into how Shakespeare worked around the writing problems so that the play could, eventually, go forwards. Or perhaps he had financial issues and that delayed aspects of production.

Hi,

My data on Cozumel is from my own personal experience as I just returned from a week long stay on May 19, 2007.  I based my comments on what the local divemasters themselves stated about the status of the reefs and the recovery.  The dive group I went with was comprised of several people that had visited just one week prior to Wilma, and they also stated that the reefs had not fully recovered.

I know what I have done at SVWP, and I have done many things wrong there. And yes, I have been trolling a few times. The problem was I didn't even think about a permanent block. I simply thought that if you were contributing constructively (no vandalism), you are welcome. But, I should've read sv:Wikipedia:Det är ingen rättighet att redigera på Wikipedia (English: Editing at Wikipedia is not a permission). If I had thought about my behavior at SVWP, I would probably have """"skärpt mig"""" (pulled myself together?) and really shown who I really am.

I am a normal user, but I just want you to know I am completely aware of my behavior at SVWP, which caused my permanent block. But please, please leave me alone from ENWP now. I know I am welcomed back to SVWP in a little less than three years. I have been behaving better here during the last month or so, and I have completely stopped engaging myself in WP:SPI and reporting you at WP:AN/WP:ANI, but please focus on more constructive things than just mentoring and preventing me from getting tools at ENWP.

 Narciso Yepes's Revolutionary Technical Developments 

This is a story that has been recounted numerous times by Yepes and by his students: """"You know, the guitar is a very unusual instrument, for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar, someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar, someone who's genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else. However, I have never felt that way about myself. When I was around 15, I could play virtually everything written for the guitar, but I knew I needed a teacher, so I went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of Vicente Ascencio, a very famous man in Spain. The first thing he asked me to play was a """"musical scale."""" I played a standard guitar scale using alternating """"i"""" and """"m"""" fingers, and I played it about as well as any guitarist I had ever heard. Ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable. He played a scale on the piano, which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale. Then, he picked up a violin, and played a scale much faster than I could play. He showed me a """"musical scale"""" on several other orchestral instruments, and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if I was to be a musician. I tried again to match his accepted norm for scales, but I could not do so. I then told him that this could not be done on the guitar, and, in fact, no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos Ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments. He told me, """"Too bad, but if you want to study music with me, you must give up the guitar. I expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm."""" Well, I had two choices. One was to be the """"genuis of the guitar,"""" to get mad and storm out the door. The other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept Ascencio as my teacher, where I would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students. Fortunately, I chose to stay and learn, for """"the door was open"""" for Ascencio to be my teacher, and I chose to swallow my pride and study with him, and THIS DECISION HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I went home, thought about scales, and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand. I started using three fingers instead (ami, mia, iam), and the next week, I was able to play a """"musical scale."""" He smiled, and told me that I did not have to give up the guitar after all. Then, he asked me for a chromatic scale in 3rds, and, again, the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing. By the next week, I had figured out a way to play 3rds at the accepted tempo. Thus we went, week after week, and I continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction. Eventually, I had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar. As a result of the experience, I have come to understand one thing:

The minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius, and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher, is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end.""""

You may also wish to look up Yepes's three-fingered scales/trills techniques 
(www.blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID;=145762269&blogID;=376067508 ). Most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical/technical theory of this (they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again). But it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and (as all great ideas) so simple and logical, it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before Yepes ever realized this theory. And that is just one of the many new techniques Yepes invented.

By now I've written (or rewritten) most of the """"People's Park"""" article.  I was there from the beginning because Jon Read, my former employer, was the landscape architect responsible for the park's initial design.  He also provided the tools to build it and donated many of the materials. 

That first weekend was terrific!  I drove my truck (the one pictured in the """"Hippie: Travel"""" section) up to the site and parked it in the middle of the park as it developed around me.  My good friend David Garthwaite convinced his sister, Terry, that they should play music, so """"The Joy of Cooking"""" jammed all day. I cooked food for the crowd in my truck and worked laying sod.  Returned home at the end of the weekend, tired and happy.

When they fenced off the park, my truck was still parked in """"The Boneyard""""a place at 5th and Delaware in Berkeley where a number of people were building boats, vans and so on.  My neighbor, Alan Blanchard, had said goodbye to his wife, Sheila, and gone up to Telegraph Ave. to work at the Berkeley Reperatory Theater doing carpentry.  He heard some noise on the street, went up to the roof to see what was happening and was immediately hit by a volley of buckshot fired by an Alameda County Sheriff's deputy.  He never saw another thing, as he was permanently blinded.  James Rector, who was standing next to him, had seen the deputy point his shotgun at them; he turned and was running away when the blast hit him in the lower abdomen.  He died four days later.

I was in Sproul Plaza for Rector's memorial service just after he died.  The National Guard troops surrounded the plaza and pointed their bayonets inward, while helicoptors dropped CS gas directly on the thousands of people who had assembled.  Walking home after this gathering, we were assaulted by National Guard troops.  That night I defied the curfew and drove my truck all around Berkeleyno one was permitted on the streets after dark, and it was obviously a """"hippie truck""""yet they never stopped me, even at the roadblocks, which I ignored.

Why ’s edits constitute violation of Wikipedia policies

Editor  repeatedly deleted duly referenced tex

Edit 1 
edit 2 
Edit 3 

Editor  repeatedly lied

 lied/mislead Wikipedia community through his edit summaries and statements.
Edit 1 – edit summary “Google Books isn't a very reliable source. Find a better source than that..”
edit 2 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
Edit 3 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
again lied that city of Concord and city of Los Angeles are next to each other to get the opposing editors blocked under sock category.

Editor  repeatedly violated WP:POV 

User:Neutralhomer ruthlessly suppressed others voice and kept on removing the referenced text by blatantly refusing to accept the wp:rs reliability of various internationally known newspapers and a very notable google book which is already part of wikipedia, i.e. Reduced to Ashes (book). User:Neutralhomer refused to accept following references only because he could not like them:

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

 Legal Action 
Wikipedia has a policy. WP:NLT and I agree with it completely. However, they do add the following: 

If you must take legal action, we cannot prevent you from doing so. However, it is required that you do not edit Wikipedia until the legal matter has been resolved to ensure that all legal processes happen via proper legal channels. You should instead contact the person or people involved directly, by email or through any other contact methods the user provides.

That makes a lot of sense. So, please provide me with some contact so that I can contact you directly in order to iron this out. For me, you can contact me at john@johnclarkprose.com. I'll be glad to hear from you, SchroCat. Also Cassianto, MisterShiney, Dr. Blowfeld, Bencherlite and Delicious carbunkle.

The outlines aren't complete, but they are complete enough to be useful to readers.  And what good is a table of contents hidden in the back?  Tables of contents are most useful in the front.

The hatnote issue is very similar to adding the """"Contents"""" link to the sidebar.  And you opposed that too, on the grounds that the system wasn't ready to be displayed.

Shenme captured the essence of the situation very well:

A 'normal' wiki usually doesn't have a core structure, and so people don't expect it, but Wikipedia has quite a lot of material, and various ways of organizing it.  Having a link in the sidebar to the contents page will help people to discover what organization there is.  (whether perfect or not a separate topic).  And, actually, pointing people to the contents page and getting their resulting comments will improve the page.  Don't wait for the improvements first...  

The OOK needs editors for each of its pages, and for the essential pages it's missing.  Relying on a small team to finish all of this will take decades. (Do the math).  I've been on this project for almost 4 years already!

So, if hatnotes will benefit readers while attracting editors to these pages, then that looks like a pretty damn good solution to me.

The AP essay was begun about April 1995, and eventually grew to include 10 parts.  The first 7 parts were written in 1995, and were published immediately as they were written.  Part 8 was a copy of an article by a journalist, Paul Maxwell, writing in the Asahi Evening News (English language newspaper in Japan).   It and parts 9 and 10 were written about February 1996.  You can be sure that by July 1995, 'the Feds' were well aware of the content of the (then-growing) AP essay. The Feds subsequently concealed their early knowledge of the AP article:  One technique they used, when the applied for a warrant, was for the affiant to claim something like, 'I first became aware of the AP essay on....'   That specific affiant ['affidavit writer' for you who don't know the law] may very well have 'first become aware' on some late date, but that doesn't mean that other Feds weren't aware, months or well over a year before.  It served the purposes of the Feds to make it appear not merely that the AP essay was written far closer to Bell's May 1997 arrest, but also to conceal the fact of their agent Walsh/Wilson's involvement perhaps one year prior to Bell's first attendance of MCCLC meetings.  Why?   It sounds much more like an 'emergency' if something happened yesterday, or last week:  They certainly wouldn't have wanted to have to tell the judge, 'Well, Bell wrote this TERRIBLE essay...two years ago' !!!
This explains, I believe, why Skomorokh claimed the AP essay was written in '1996', and furthermore gave no references. '1996' (at least, December 1996) sounds reasonably close to early 1997.  'April 1995', on the other hand, sounds like an eternity from May 1997, the month Bell was arrested.  71.36.117.224",0,0,0,0,0,0

Anyway, I think that sentence would do well to include a brief decription of what is meant by an anti-pattern.  You can click through to the link, but I think that the references in the article should be a bit more contained.  It's a zinger of a sentence, but it refers to a very specific piece of knowledge that the article shouldn't assume the average reader has.

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""" but this was dismissed as """"speculative opinion"""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is there really """"westerners"""" listening to Cantopop?  I doubt the sentence """"To western ears,..."""" is NPOV.

The article fails to mention the composer 顧家輝, singer 仙度拉, and their song 啼笑姻緣 which overturned the preception that Cantopop as a second grade Music (i.e. for old uneducated person only).  And it was Sammy Hui who finally pushed Cantopop to overtake Mandarin pop as the music of choice for HK youths.  
Yes no mention at all of the Gu Gaa-fai,Wong Jim collaboration. No mention at all of the popularity of TVB TV theme songs, while everbody else was sticking their own lyrics onto somebody elses music these two, seemed to be the only people producing original material. 

 I'll try to NPOV the article more, but I claim no responsbility on contentyou can't get much further from my musical domain than Cantopop.  05:06 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 No problem.  I bet you have the chance to listen to the most popular Cantopop songs but not the best.  I will get the same preception if I listen only to Madonna or Britney Spears.

I didn't mean that I wouldn't like it.  I meant that I've never heard any, and I certainly don't know the history behind it, so my editing is limited to grammar and attempts at NPOV. )  05:23 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 Tones 

I heard that Cantonese music differs from Mandarin in that Mandarin respects the language tones in the melody, but Cantonese doesn't. Is it true?
 

 Good Cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody, as all Chinese dialects are tone-sensitive. What you heard is a recent disaster in HK music, beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important.  But there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. 

Cantonese is more tonal than Mandarin.  Mandarin only has 4 tones for each pronunciation, but Cantonese has at least 6 tones according to most dictionaries.  Some author even claims there are 9 tones in Cantonese.  Even though written Chinese can be pronunced in Cantonese or Mandarin, but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a Cantonese song in Mardarin nor vice versa.  Many popular tunes get both Cantonese and Mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects.   20:31, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Yes but Mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.I've heard people talk about Cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. 

And, how do Cantopop artists deal with music piracy? 
 

 Cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as European or American artists, i.e. virtually nothing they can do!!! 

 But I was under the impression that in HK and Canton, media piracy was much much higher than in Europe or America. But there still are Cantopop artists. Are the economic models different? Do they resort to corporate patronage? ...  

 Curious: How did you hear that """"height"""" in Cantonese areas?  00:40 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 I meant South China in general, but it should affect Cantopop. My source is Slashdot . Ehem. I think I read something in Wired of Bruce Sterling finding dirt-cheap pirated media there, but I don't find it. I though tit was common knowledge.  

You have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. Joey Yung and Twins going on TV and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their livlihoods.And yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a sort.In the Joey Yung interview I was referring to, she claimed that she was making no money on her albums, but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase. With a large enough fanbase she can make money on personal appearances and concerts.For example Jade Kwan has recently been booked by a chain of bars, in the mainland, for a dozen or so 20 minute mini-concerts.Furthermore if you are popular enough you can make money through endorsments.There isn't a single reasonably attractive female cantopop singer who isn't e",0,0,0,0,0,0

 The Dalai Lama has “banned” the practice of Dorje Shugden and in so doing caused a rift in the Tibetan community as it is a widespread practice.[6] Tibetan and Western practitioners are currently organizing demonstrations against the Dalai Lama's ban wherever the Dalai Lama appears, accusing him of denying them religious freedom.[7] The representative of the Dalai Lama appeared in Hamilton New York to say that from a legal standpoint there is no ban. However, he was contradicted by the practical examples and stories of Dorje Shugden practitioners which clearly indicate that while legally there may be no ban, from the point of view of discrimination there is clearly a ban in effect and it arises from the Dalai Lama’s words. The representative said that he would look into all the evidences of human rights abuse within the Tibetan community in India and agreed that they were wrong.[8]

 Recent rename to Relationships between American Jewish religious movements 

I don't understand why this article renamed. All of the major movements involved  Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform  have both international histories and a contemporary international presence. The current article content does unduly reflect an American point of view, but this can be fixed. Best,  
I did this because, after reading the page over several times, it only had US denominational connection. True we might all be aware that each of the denominations has an international counterpart - but that isn't reflected on this page, by its creator or subsequent, numerous editors. Of course if this was not the proper thing to do, it can be changed back...but the whole page would need to be heavily added to. It is a shame this couldn't be purged entirely and a new section added to the denomination page. Best wishes,  

Agreeing with Shirahadasha, I don't think it makes sense to limit this article to American movements. Better to fix the content, because the geographic limit is quite artificial. For instance, what about Israeli Orthodox commenting on American movements, or vice versa? We certainly don't want to have this """"relationships"""" topic segmented for UK and Germany and Hungary, because movements and individuals  constantly interact and comment across geographic boundaries. We need to revisit the title.  | Talk 

Before we worry about the world-wide perspective - which I agree would be interesting - perhaps we should focus first on getting a well sourced WP:NPOV article on the USA.  There is a huge amount of material on the US alone to sort through.   

Several problems. (1) Many sources and notable figures do not limit their remarks to a geographic denomination. Hence, when R. Feinstein or Joel Roth comment on other movements, they don't refer only to Jews and organizations within the US. (2) Accordingly, the current article's content is not limited to the US. (3) The discourse of the movements cannot be segregated geographically enough to justify segregated articles. For these reasons, I will would like to move it back and open the discussion here. Thanks.  | Talk 

There is plenty of material available (e.g. historical, socialogical, literary) that is indeed region specific.  This article hasn't even begun to scratch the surface of that material.
Why is it relevant that Joel Roth says things that are worldwide? If claim A applies to US and claim A applies to Israel, then A is appropriate in any of the following three articles: (a) an article on the US (b) an article on israel and (c) an article on the US and israel.
The material on other areas (e.g. israel) is volumous - Israel deserves its own article.
If we write a good article on the US and then start writing one on Israel, and while writing the one on israel notice that we need to reuse material, then we can always add a third article with the shared material.
Even if we need shared material (e.g. for Israel and the US) it does not change the fact that both countries have denominational relationships that are complex enough and sufficiently sourced to each need their own article.
Finally, its better to do a little well, then try to do too much and do it poorly.   

(outdent) The following aspects of the article are not limited to internal USA relationships:
 Haredi views of Modern Orthodox, generally 
 R. Feinstein on non-Orthodox Jews
 Haredia on """"heretical intent and the 1800s widespread denigration of religion.""""
 Modern Ortho on non-Orthodox generally
 R. Soloveitchik  not discussing American non-Ortho alone
 R. Lamm saying """"non-Orthodox rabbis and laypeople may possess spiritual dignity"""" etc
 R. Berger: """"The Jewish loyalties and observances of non-Orthodox Jews are decidedly better than nothing."""" etc
 Conservative views of Orthodox are not limited to American Orthodox, and general view is held by Masorti/Conservative too
 R. Schorsch: """"claimed that Orthodox organizations in Israel politically discriminate against non-Orthodox Jews"""" obviously not US
 The Reform section is not only USA, mostly historical

Herby and ABF: Wikipedia found a way to block this IP range without blocking the entire range.  If you look at this thread on ANI, the message by Wknight tells you the range to block to at least make it more of a pain for the person to have to continually reset their modem until they find an open protocol.

 Leading paragraphs for articles 

Hi SamClark, this is just a comment that was made to me, that I thought I would pass onto you, for you to think about and respond how you please. The leading paragrpahs in Global Justice, and your draft at User:Sam Clark/justice read like the introduction to an essay. Particularly the last sentences which say what the article will discuss. This is what I did when I created a few articles from scratch, mainly because the only type of writing I ever do is for essays. But a couple of people have commented that as an encyclopaedic article, the first section is more like a synopsis rather than an introduction, and would generally just sum up the points of the rest of the article.

For instance, instead of 
It considers the various ways in which justice has been understood, distinguishes two broad kinds of justice, and then describes several theories of justice under each of those two headings.
It could say something like:
There are various ways to understand justice, but generally you ca distinguish between two kinds of justice: distributive justice and retributive justice. Distributive justice is concerned with the proper distribution of good things while Retributive justice is concerned with the proper response to wrongdoing.

And then it would just go straight into the article. If you look at most of the long-standing and comprehensive articles that seems to be the way they are written. Cheers.  

 Heh - good point. In my case, it's being in the habit of writing lecture-notes, but the same point applies. I'll change. Thanks,  

 Rewrite of Justice 

I think it would be great to see the derivation of the word justice from the latin (not the french) etc and perhaps a section on history on how our understanding of the term has evolved (ie. what it meant in different times and different places). Justice is defintely a philosophical concept and so it is important to discuss the philosophical meanings and debates concerning justice, but it is also a political/judicial term as well as an everday term that people use and so it would be good to have all of this represented in the article eventually. I think stuff like this from the original article is very important: 
In most cases what one regards as """"just"""" (not necessarily meaning what is just) is determined by consulting established and agreeable principles, employing logic, or, natural law In specific systems justice is determined, by consulting a majority, or in social contexts where religion dominates, justice may be thought to require deference to religious texts or to spiritual guidance, under a monarchy or authoritarian state the ruler/s determined what was just and doled out justice. All of these determinants of justice have at times delivered particularlly dark periods of history where justice was seen to be absent. If a person lives under a specific set of laws in a country, concepts of """"justice"""" are often simply deferential to the existing law —the issuing of punitive reprimands for violations may be referred to as """"serving justice."""" In principle, this fits the general concept in that the individuals get what is supposedly due to them. Justice however, is a universal and absolute concept; laws, principles, religion, etc., are merely attempts to codify the concept  occasionally with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

I have to plead guilty about putting technical discussions on these pages, but that was brought about because Pcarbonn wanted to argue every detail I tried to add.

In agreement with the comments above, the article always was too biased towards the 'reality' of cold fusion, and I tried to make it less so, with the result that I was opposed at every step by Pcarbonn.  The general state of affairs regarding cold fusion today, as observed by myself as a worker in the field of the materials claimed to show CF, is that the average scientist thinks the issue was setled c. 1994, with CF being declared 'bad science' (or pathological or pseudoscience, they don't tend to distinguish between these various terms).  Almost universally (including me), these scientists when presented with current CF papers or statements say """"What? I thought that was over.""""  A very few are aware it is not, most of them are somewhat incensed that CF is NOT dead, and, at this point, only one (me) has actually studied the field and published conventional explanations (the other, W. B. Clarke, passed away).  This situation has allowed the CF die-hards to experience a resurgence of their view in the popular press, since not enough informed scientists are available to stop them (which is not a nefarious plot, they just do lousy science and rarely make it through a good peer review) and they actively suppress mention of the outstanding criticisms of their work.

Here is the problem that I have with this. They built a structure before Benjamin Franklin. Nowhere in my own indepdnent research is there any substantiative proof that contends that when this tower was built in Russia, it was specificially intended to strike lightning. They might have built a lightning rod. However, that very well was not their intention, thus not realizing what they accomplished.

In order to claim an """"invention"""", one has to conceive of the initial and original idea. And that is exactly what Benjamin Franklin did in 1749 with his kite experiments and work in electricity. 

Also, I stand by my point that the citation/reference being used is quite unacceptable. This is English Wikipedia and not Russian Wikipedia. A reader of this pae should not have to have the text translated thereby setting themselves up for misinterpretation of what is being claimed.

Hello Rigadoun, your query raises a puzzle for which I would welcome your input.

I'm sure we agree that editing without a reference source is a terrible idea, and articles should have lots and lots of in-line references to indicate where all the material came from.

But what if all the material comes from one single reference source?  In such a case, I could, in principle, add a footnote to every sentence, which would cite the very same source.  But this seems a little bit inelegant and reader-unfriendly to me.  I felt it better simply to declare, once and for all, that everything in the article came from the same source.  Yours sincerely,

The FIDESZ-MPP are nationalists, and very likely ultra-nationalists. Why? First of all, a number of mass media articles and other coverage, both domestic (Hungarian) and foreign, have concluded, based on their actions, statements, rallies, and their own admission, that they are nationalists or ultra-nationalists. Something I witnessed in Budapest during the elections in 2002: FIDESZ-MPSZ (the part after the hyphen has changed over and over) told their voters, most of whom do not deny being nationalists, to wear the national colors pin, or cocard, and carry Hungarian flags during the elections, at all times if possible, to show that they are true, patriotic Hungarians, unlike the MSZP and their junior SZDSZ, who, acccording to FIDESZ, are traitors of the nation!!! Of the total Hungarian voting population at least 50% of them favor MSZP, SZDSZ, and an assortium of other progressive parties or the relatively moderate MDF! In fact, Mrs. Ibolya David, head of the MDF (Magyar Demokrata Forum) broke up with Mr. Viktor Orban and have since been bitter rivals for the affections of the right-wing voters!!! Anyway, I will not put the term """"nationalists"""" or """"ultra-nationalists"""" myself, since I was the first to notice the ommission, but I strongly suggest it should be done for historic accuracy's sake. FIDESZ-MPP are more like Austrian Jorg Haider's Freedom Party than Wolfgang Schussel's Conservative Party. Ultimately anyone concerned can contact Amnesty International or French Conservative party (Chirac will no longer take Orban's calls...wonder why...and Angela Merkel of Germany would not come to Hungary to show up for Viktor during the 2006 Spring elections...hmmm...).

Early radio career
Mills began his career at 16 as a DJ on his local Hampshire commercial radio station, Power FM, after barraging the station with demo tapes.  He was given the chance to present a weeks worth of shows, and based on the success of this, was immediately offered the 'graveyard slot' of 1:00 am – 6:00 am six nights a week, making him the youngest permanent presenter on mainstream commercial radio.  His popularity led to a quick move to the coveted late afternoon 'drive time'.

Mills moved from Power FM on to GWR FM and stayed with the station for two years.  His next station was Piccadilly Key 103 in Manchester where he once more progressed quickly from the late night slot to the mid-morning position.  In 1995, Mills moved to the then new London radio station of Heart 106.2.

Mills has provided various voiceovers, including the voice of specialist in-store radio station 'Homebase FM',  the voiceover for Blockbuster Inc.'s in-store infomercial channel 'Blockbuster TV', and more recently, the voiceover for 'The VH1 Album Chart' on UK television channel VH1. 

BBC Radio 1
Mills joined BBC Radio 1 in 1998 to present The Early Breakfast Show between the hours of 4am and 7am. In January 2004, Mills was moved to a weekend afternoon slot, which only lasted for just over 6 months, as in July 2004 he moved over to the weekday early-evening slot, initially covering Sara Cox who was on maternity leave. When Sarah did not return to the slot, Scott took it over as his own The Scott Mills Show.  Mills also provides holiday cover for other slots including The Chris Moyles Show.

The Scott Mills Show, in its current format, runs from 4pm to 7pm, Monday to Friday.  It is co-presented by sports reporter and occasional presenter Mark Chapman (Chappers). The assistant producer was Laura Sayers until April 2008. The current assistant producer is Rebecca Huxtable, usually called 'Beccy' or 'Wacky Beccy' on air. The regular newsreader is Tulip Mazumdar. The producer of the show is Emlyn Dodd, although he is referred to on air as 'The one who doesn't speak'.

 Website display 

I'm just curious, especially because I've been seeing several editors doing this, but why would you change """"Evanescence.com"""" to """"www.Evanescence.com"""" (as you did here), when the former is a perfectly valid link to their website and is much more visually pleasing? —  (t @ c) 

The infobox doc has the standard format as """"www.example.com"""" and the Official link at the bottom of the page was directed to www.ev.com so I followed that pattern as well.  Also, as you mentioned, most other pages have the www. on there as well. Most of the time the reasoning is because when visiting the domain without the """"www."""" subdomain, it redirects to it with the """"www."""" anyway.  Apparently this is not the case with the Evanescence website (as I have just verified).  I was really just looking for consistency, though.  Since the Ev pages all had """"www."""" listed, I kept it consistent by making the infobox the same.  I agree that Evanescence.com looks better.  However, all official channels such as their official twitter page (as well as Amy Lee's official twitter page), the official youtube page, and even the WindUp records website links to """"www.Evanescence.com"""". I believe that we should follow suit. ~ [ Scott M. Howard ]:[ Talk ] ~ 

Okay, that's fine. For most any modern website, the """"www"""" is almost completely redundant, and I personally loath such things, but it really makes no difference for our purposes here. The infobox doc makes no sense to me with that """"standard"""", since IIRC http:// and https:// could technically direct viewers to two different websites, so why not require that part as well? Feels like over-standardisation. —  (t @ c) 

I just figure consistency throughout Evanescence is best.  If that's how they advertise themselves, I guess that's how we should.  On the subject of """"www"""", I agree that it's completely redundant.  The only reason it exists seems to be out of habit. lol  It even sounds stupid on radio or TV when people are advertising their sites """"Go to double-you double-you double-you dot ..."""" Got a studder, pal?  I dunno.  It sorta goes with my want to use metric in the united states... but we know THAT will probably never change as a standard either. ah, well. =D ~ [ Scott M. Howard ]:[ Talk ] ~ 

Indeed! Why oh why can't we just switch to metric? I'm not sure what you mean by """"advertise""""? You mean how the site is presented by the group in other media? I don't really understand how that is relevant to how it should be displayed by anyone else, but all that's irrelevant! D —  (t @ c) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

I looked through several bios on bookrag and none, some of which were pretty lengthy, mentioned Falk. It's off topic and additionally, he doesn't even have an article.  

Well, I'm not sure that Falk needs to be included in the Jordan article or not (though he did seem to have a huge influence on Jordan's career), but in any case, I have written a Wikipedia article for David Falk.  I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good, and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article (as I look at the Jordan article again, it even says in the second sentence that """"he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation""""... since it was Falk who did the marketing, he probably deserves a link there).  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstan's book Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made, which has about 10 pages on Falk, as well as a ton of online articles I found.  Cheers!   

I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section """"Media figure and business interests.""""  Falk is probably too off-topic to put him in the opening section, but I think he's important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordan's role as a media figure, since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordan's image.  

 Divorce 

Is is just me or does it seem like, unlike an earlier divorce threat five years ago, Michael & Juanita's split seemed to have been kept quiet by most of the media?

I'm wondering because the first I've heard of the current proceedings was last night when I heard something about this being the most expensive celebrity divorce ever?   
Five years ago, he was still in the NBA, so obviously he has a bigger spot light on him. For the most part, Jordan isn't under the lime light anymore, so it doesn't have much coverage.  
It was announced in the press when it happened. But it was one of those things where people stopped talking about it a couple of days later.  

 Comment Page text 

The following text has been moved from the comment subpage which clutters the WPChi template:

Nick Names
I don't believe the Nickname """"Superman"""" is valid in the case of MJ. Yes, he was called Superman, Pippen was called Batman, and Rodman, Rod-man for a brief time. But Superman as a nickname has been used for almost every prominent player in the NBA; i.e. Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and especially Shaq. Nicknames should be identifiable to unique players. If you ask someone who knows nothing about Basketball, what were Jordan's nicknames, they would say Air, or Air Jordan, and throw in the acronym's, M.J. Jordan has had plenty of nicknames, but we don't list every single Nickname, only the most identifiable. That's why his NBA.com Historical Bio, only lists Air Jordan as his nickname. I propose mutual consensus on the issue, before more users begin to add obsessive Wp:fancruft to the article. Feel free to comment.  
Agree, Superman is not a common nickname for him. At all. It gets used all the time for athletes. Unless he gets a Superman tattoo on his arm like Shaq and starts calling himself Superman it's not worth inclusion.

Langston Hughes
Hi Bobcat, I saw that you have submitted Langston Hughes for GA review. Having been involved in some of the GA process I have to say, I don't think LH is ready for this, for various reasons. There is not one major editor looking after or improving the page and hasn't been for many years. This means there's nobody involved who's ready and set to do all the work to bring it up to GA standard. Much of it has no citation, which is a must for a GA. There is no section about the themes and/or style of his work, critical appraisal and such, which is also needed. I appreciate it's a vote of confidence in the article, which is great, but I know that there is a long GA appraisal backlog and it's a pretty time consuming process for reviewers. (There's work waiting since January to be reviewed). Maybe have a look at poet's articles such as W. B. Yeats, Maya Angelou and Walt Whitman to get a sense of what's needed. Editors often submit articles for a peer review first, to get a general sense of where the article is at and what works needs doing, before applying for the whole GA/FA hog. So, I'd personally recommend withdrawing the application for GA and maybe work on some of the article points until the basics are in place. Thanks and best wishes   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

2e63a9e7cfff7830,"""Is Ethylene Glycol a Synonym for Antifreeze?

Update 2 My intent in editing out the extraneous information of ethylene glycol poisoning in the Antifreeze article is that many editors and visitors to the Article are of the impression that all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol. This is a misconception. Case in point? Look above at the comments made by Flyer22 and TechnoSymbiosis. 1. Note that they mention articles in which the poisonous chemical is the Article in question. 2. Lead, Mercury (element), Asbestos, Benzodiazepine, paracetamol. That is a list of six 5 chemical substances and asbestos, which is virtually a chemical species for the purposes of this discussion. 3. Note also that the article in question here is not about a specific chemical, rather it is about a wide range of substances including the poisonous and deadly methanol and ethylene glycol. The article isn't about a chemical species like mercury or lead. It is about liquids (plural) which have special properties in commerce and mechanics and discusses practical applications of chemicals.

So when auto mechanics or airplane mechanics discuss antifreeze, or when chemists discuss it or talk about it, this poisoning aspect is a rare but useful part of the discussion. It is only when talking about this topic medically that the need arises to discuss the many symptoms and embark upon long-winded treatises on what happens internally to a person intoxicated on a particular antifreeze. In commercial, practical, and chemical discussions, the fact that something is toxic arises obtusely to the main concern.

Take those ethylene glycol warnings to the Ethylene glycol page and (if there was any sudden interest in it) to the Methanol article, which would be consistent with the 6 examples listed above. As a sideline, why aren't there any warnings of the deadliness of methanol, which is soooooo poisonous that it takes 10 mL of it to blind a person, and 30 mL to kill. Sounds pretty notable by the above standards, so let's list all of the symptoms in the antifreeze article, too. Or not. That would be borderline absurd, since the ethylene glycol lobby dictates that ethylene glycol is synonymous with Antifreeze.

Another absurd corollary would be to go to the Thermal insulation page and discuss how poisonous Asbestos is. I mean, all insulation is asbestos, right?

To summarize, this argument is about the scope of Antifreeze. I don't think this scope encompasses the symptoms of poisoning (from a particular type of antifreeze) which happen to be so difficult to spot that they deserve the full attention available at the Good Article named Ethylene glycol poisoning where all of the nuances of medical research and diagnosis can be discussed at length.   

 So fix the misconception, don't just blank an entire section.  

 Most antifreeze is still ethylene glycol. It's hardly an obscure risk.     

No one is or has stated that """"ethylene glycol is a synonym for antifreeze."""" And the misconception that """"all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol"""" can also be mentioned in the aforementioned section, although I have not read anyone in the discussions about this on this talk page express any misconception (especially since you've expressd such concerns before). Somehow, you are completely missing the point about why you are wrong to repeatedly remove this information. The point is that ethylene glycol poisoning, which is a part of this article, causes these symtoms; and therefore, there should be an appropriate summary of these symptoms, per WP:Summary style, before pointing readers to the article about it. It is not """"extraneous information."""" So once again, I will contact WP:MED to comment here on this issue. In the meantime, this information stays per the WP:Consensus against your repeated removal of it. 134.255.247.88

Crime

Nicaragua Managua is not a safe city okay i had copy the article word by word and it now has been chaged okay. here it is.

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua reported these incidents: 

Crime in Nicaragua is in high rise and the National Police does not have the resources to combat it. Crime in Managua has had a steady growth throughout the years. Managua the capital of Nicaragua is exceptionally extremely dangerous specially at night, street crime is very common. Majority of the violent crime that is on the rise is due to the countries extreme poverty and lack of jobs. The following incidents took place in March and April of this year 2007. 

Hotel Robberies 

On March 29, an American couple visited the city of Granada where they where robbed at gunpoint in their rental home. Several days before the couple was robbed they contacted the management about a missing light in the unit. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the robbery, a Nicaraguan male in his late 20s (the suspect) was at the front gate of the property he said that he was there to fix the light. The victim walked the individual inside the home, where he inspected the light. The victim then walked the suspect outside so he could get his tools. As they got near the front door, the suspect stopped and pulled out what the victim described was a .25 caliber or similar to the type automatic pistol and demanded the American couple give him all their money. The suspect took the victim’s wallet, took all of the cash and then, at the victims request his wallet was returned holding only his identification, The suspect then departed the area on foot. 

On April 4, seventeen members of a U.S. missionary group were robbed at gunpoint while having dinner at their hotel in Managua. The U.S. missionary group was given housing at a locally-owned hotel located in a area not frequented by tourists. Four Nicaraguan males, including two armed with handguns, entered the dining room and took the group’s cell phones and all their money. Two of the suspects walked the members of the U.S missionary group to their hotel rooms where they stole their digital cameras, additional cash and iPods. The robbery lasted one hour, a hotel employee was able to get away and called the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP). The Nicaraguan National Police did not arrive, however, until after the suspects had left the scene. None of the victims were badly hurt. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua strongly recommends all visitors and tourists to Nicaragua utilize hotels and guest houses that have a front desk, security, or concierge that is staffed 24 hours a day; full-time uniformed security; access control precautions; a fenced perimeter and a well lit and patrolled parking area; and rooms equipped with safes for valuables and travel documents. 

Vehicular Break-Ins

In the early afternoon on April 21, a vehicle belonging to an American organization was broken into at a gas station in Managua. The vehicle had stopped at the gas station on Carretera Sur (South Highway), about two miles from the U.S. Embassy in Managua. When leaving the car to make purchases in the station store, a young Nicaraguan male approached the driver and said he’d watch the vehicle for money. The driver accepted this offer and the car’s passengers entered the gas station. When leaving the gas station, they found that the young Nicaraguan male who had offered to watch the car was already gone and they noticed that the rear passenger door window had been broken. A briefcase that held files and their identification documents where also taken from the rear seat. The young male who had offered to watch the car returned to the scene. The NNP took him in to further investigate the case but were unable to confirm his direct involvement in the crime. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy Managua recommends that travelers do not leave valuables where they can be seen in parked cars and, when possible, park in a location where the vehicle can be monitored or where they have cameras.

WP:AGF only goes so far, especially when there is the appearance of an agenda (supporting one's opinion is one thing; mentioning the victim most every time is another). As to the content of the SeaWorld article itself, it needs work ... no question. Clean out the marketing spin and focus on SeaWorld's history prior to its acquisition by Anheuser-Busch (at which point it became part of Busch Entertainment Corporation, which is now SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). As to """"favorable vs. unfavorable,"""" if that's truly how I felt, such incidents articles wouldn't exist. I've gone through with SpikeJones and other editors to keep everything consistent, first getting involved with them after the monorail accident in July 2009, when this exact same issue came up, and again consensus was that leaving out the victim's name didn't damage the article, nor did it add any significant value to it (at which point, tie goes to """"leave it out""""). After that, it was the rash of lewd-behavior incidents at Central Florida water parks ... again, if I was trying to protect the parks, I wouldn't have allowed the information in, as if it were completely up to me, anyway. Heck, I added a number of them into their respective articles, and I fleshed out others with more details and more source information to back it all up! (In the interest of full disclosure, the victims in those incidents were generally minors, which (a) wouldn't have been named by the news and (b) if some unscrupulous person had gotten a hold of the names, I have no doubt the names would be expunged immediately and nobody who really had the project's best interests at heart would put up a fight. In not so many words, while also incidents, they did have special conditions that don't make them good examples in this dispute.)

These incidents articles are based purely on what's in the local newspapers, with no candy-coating, no PR spin ... save one thing, which has been followed with almost all the incident/accident articles I've reviewed, both theme-park and non-theme-park. Unless they were already notable, victims' names aren't included, because they aren't necessary to, as you put it, tell the story. There are, of course, exceptions (such as the victims of the Titanic), but the theme park incident articles are consistent.

Lastly, as to your assertion of WP:COI, I'd welcome any proof you'd care to provide in regards to edits being made currently. Previous COI edits, such as those that inspired the newspaper article you cited, should indeed be expunged and replaced by neutral point of view information. But that's an issue for another day.

Psoriosis and eczma Common Cause.

I would like edit it correctly so as to benefit many sufferers. I have simply copied in the three articles that join together to indicate a cause for eczma/ psoriosis. These are factual and are in the wikipedia. As follows. This is very acurate information. This is true information and this parasite ( ascaris)is a cause of both eczma and or psoriosis.

All I have done is join the dots wikipedia has the answers many sufferers are looking for. 

Connecting the dots isn't allowed, I'm afraid. It's called synthesis and is considered a form of original research, which is against our policies here. If ascaris is acknowledged to be the cause of psoriasis, it would be best to source this fact from an article in a medical journal or perhaps a medical textbook. -",0,0,0,0,0,0
16ceb013bcda3d9d,"""

I would be glad to, Noformation. A conflict of interest is defined as """"Where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of Wikipedia"""". The aims of Wikipedia is to produce a """"neutral, reliably sourced encyclopedia"""". My position is that editors from the rational-skeptic wikiproject and their ilk are NOT neutral in this subject, and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture, no specialist dedicated learning in it, have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it, and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature, and they are ill-equiped to provide a full, rounded, mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.

Now, as for myself, I will tell it straight, I work 12~15 hours per week in acupuncture practice, earning $35 per hour. Acupuncture practice is not my main source of income, in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it. It requires 10,000 hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline, and one day I aim to achieve mastery in this discipline.

I refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified, have the most experience, have done the most study, and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of COI. In fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable, far more valuable than the input of ivory-tower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical, critical and dismissive point of view. In fact, considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page, which emulates the tone of those """"Quackwatch"""" websites that proliferate on the web these days, and considering their devoted following of Edzard Ernst and their elevation of his work as the number 1 source on the page (literally), and their transparent agenda of """"de-bunking"""" the """"pseudo-science"""" they consider acupuncture to be, it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are """" advancing outside interests"""" rather than being neutral, and thus they in breach of COI, as opposed to I.

However, I have to say I do not read the first paragraph the same way Graft does, I see no non-sequitor.  The subject of the first sentence is not inherited traits (that is in the predicate) and the subject of the second sentence is not fact versus theory (which again is in the predicate.  The subject of the first sentence is """"evolution"""" and the predicate provides a definition.  The subject of the second sentence is evolutionary biology - the field of academe that makes the study of evolution its object, and the source of just about all the contents of the article.  The third sentence goes on to tell us about what we learn from evolutionary biology.  This progression (define a subject, explain who studies/has expertise in it, then elaborate on this field of study) makes perfect sense to me.

 Do not restore Wenner quote in Bob Marley article 

The quote is erroneous. It is egotistical and serves Wenner not Marley. Reggae is not mystic music it may be called spiritual - mystic may seem to have the same meaning as spiritual but its loaded with ideas of magic and other such mystic rubbish - palm reading crap.

He did not have anything in common with John Lennon especially the nonsense lyrics that Lennon engaged in to insult his sycophantic fans (something Marley never did). And Marley would not say we are bigger than God and that religion will end as Lennon did. Let alone write a song about his mother as Lennon did which sounds like Lennon has issues.

Bob Dylan is nothing to do with Bob Marley - if you added him to the Hendrix article then yes because Hendrix was a fan.

The quote is typical of magazine publishers. It is designed to serve them. A good example is the recent Rupert Murdoch quote: """"This is the humblest day of my life"""" that led to him receiving a custard pie in the face. It was not his humblest day and he was at the inquiry because there had been a serious breach of civilized behavior from the editors of his publications. 

Pack it in. If Wenner wants to promote this magazine then let him take a full ad out in the New York Times.

Do not restore the erroneous quote.

Thanks for the clarification; the Stalinist nomenclature is puzzling. But here's one more detail on the citation:

Citation 23 at http://www.xtimeline.com/evt/view.aspx?id=15752, states that that Picasso recieved the """"Lenin Peace Prize"""" in 1961, but is reported in the Picasso text as 1962.

The Wiki source, at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin_Peace_Prize, says 1962 (""""International Lenin Prize""""). Can we use our wiki site as a source, or is that considered bad form?

no content
an infobox can be  contentthe one on Keenan Davis  just needs rewriting in sentences. Please check WP:CSD for the actual criteria for speedy deletion. '''''' ( talk ) 

Generally, a biography should have content about biographical information on the subject (not just player stats). Statistical information, such as date and place of birth, information on historical significance (N/A here), pictures, and information on accomplishments is usually accepted as the content of a biography on Wikipedia. What we have here are some of Keenan Davis' NFL stats. The page should be written from his childhood/early years up to how he got into the NFL and what he did to get there (such as being in minor leagues), like any normal biography.

I understand your point on how infoboxes can be content, but in this situation what we have is a biography with just NFL stats. How can we consider that a biography?

 Prince/Duchess of Cambridge 

Because the child is a boy and because the Duke of Cambridge's second title is the Earl of Strathearn we now know that the new baby is HRH The Earl of Strathearn, since he takes his fathers next title by courtesy, just as other heirs to British Dukes do, so the title of the article should be HRH The Earl of Strathearn, and it should also be noted in the section about his Title and Style. 31.109.139.238  
Dukes heir uses a courtesy title only if he have no title by own right. Now he is Prince george of Cambridge he don't need a courtesy title. If Prince William predesease his father, the new born will prince george the duke of Cambridge and etc.
eg:- George V 's third son was styled HRH The Prince Henry, The Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden. his heirs(first Prince William then Prince Richard after his brothers death) hold Princely titles because of Kings male line grand children, as called Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard of Gloucester instead of Earl of Ulster. But Present Duke, prince Richards children don't have princely titls because they are kings great grand children(Only Prince of Wales elderst sons children get princely titles among kings grand children) and his son called Earl of Ulster and sons heir and elderst son called Lord Culloden.  

When the child has been born, assuming we don't know the given name immediately, should we move this article to Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge? This article may be linked on the Main page under In the news, so we should probably be prepared for that. I noticed there was already an Unnamed Prince of Cambridge and an Unnamed Princess of Cambridge redirecting to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge#Pregnancy (I have just edited them to redirect here instead). Online 
No, that would not be right. The child will not be Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge, i.e. that will not be a substantive title like Prince of Wales or Duke of Cambridge. The child will be a prince of the United Kingdom known as Prince(ss) X of Cambridge. It would be best to just leave the article at Child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge until the child is named; the present title certainly won't become less accurate or less precise once the childis born.   

The child will be officially entitled Prince (Name) of Cambridge or Princess (Name) of Cambridge. So probably not.  (Want to have a chat?) 
Prince(ss) NN of Cambridge would be the best answer, but seeing as the child will be given a name within the first couple days anyway, there's no point moving the article only to move it again a couple days later. The Princess NN of Country came about mostly because of the Danish tradition of waiting until the baptism to name the child, so the articles were made when the children were born and then we had an article in place while we waited for the name. In other cases, ie Princess Estelle of Sweden or Princess Eleonore of Begium, the article Princess NN of Sweden/Belgium was created and then moved within a day or two to its proper location when their names were announced. But this article is already in place, so moving it, only to move it yet again a day or two later is pointless.   
Personally, I think Norman is a great name for a Prince, although Princess NN also has a certain ring to it.  
I agree with Morhange. Additionally, we might not be certain as to the child's precise style until one is used (styles have broken precedent before, remember!), so we really ought to avoid assuming something based on precedent which could soon turn out to be WRONG... BD 

The style of the boy is given as """"His Royal Highness Prince [name] of Cambridge"""" on the official webpages of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - so speculation about that can now end... (www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/the-duchess-of-cambridge-has-been-delivered-of-son)
