Thanks.  ayanosh

 From user Jshapely 

Dear reviewer,

thank you very much for your suggestions on the article I wrote on Alessandro Liberati. To address your concerns about his notability:

he is especially known as one of the founders of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of over 28,000 volunteers in more than 100 countries formed to organize research information about health care interventions in a systematic way, to aid well informed health care decisions (see also the description available in Wikipedia about the Collaboration). To date, more than 5000 “systematic reviews” on specific topics have been published in the Cochrane Library. Due to its relevance, widely acknowledged by clinicians, health care researchers and policymakers, the Cochrane Collaboration has a seat on the World Health Assembly to provide inputs on resolutions of the World Health Organization. The founder role of Liberati has been acknowledged by Sir Iain Chalmers Chalmers I. Alessandro Liberati: a personal appreciation. Epidemiologia & Prevenzione 2012;36:3. Available at http://www.epiprev.it/attualit%C3%A0/alessandro-liberati-un-ricordo-personale, who is himself acknowledged as one of the founders of the Collaboration in 1993 (see his profile in Wikipedia). The Italian Cochrane Centre was one of the first to be established (in 1994). Other people have their profile on Wikipedia mainly because of their role in the Collaboration (aside from Iain Chalmers, see also Dave Sackett and Chris Silagy). The relevant role of Liberati in the Collaboration can be also better understood by reading the countless acknowledgements in the farewell page http://www.cochrane.org/features/farewell-professor-alessandro-liberati  and in the memory book http://www.cochrane.org/alessandro-memory-book posted on the Cochrane website.
As for his published work (one of the relevant features indicated in the Wikipedia notability guidelines for academics) he is author of more than 200 papers published in peer reviewed and indexed journals, as it can be easily verified in Pubmed or in Google Scholar; some of these papers represent highly cited academic work, especially on how to report results of meta analyses and systematic reviews. 
As for other characteristics which can be worth highlighting (also according to the Wikipedia guidelines), he was on editorial boards of prestigious and selective academic journals, such as the Annals of Internal Medicine (house organ of the American College of Physicians) and the British Medical Journal (of the British Medical Association).
Last but not the least, several obituary articles followed his death on specialized medical journals; among these, I would like to highlight the one on The Lancet Watts G. Alessandro Liberati. Lancet 2012;379:214 (which is, according to the Journal Citation Index, the second general medical journal for number of citations) and the one on the British Medical Journal Magrini N, Smith R. Alessandro Liberati. Campaigned for high quality evidence relevant to patients. BMJ 2012;344:e1101
All these things I tried to make explicit in my article, supporting them with several citations for verifiability (a few of which also available online). I understand your point that my article may appear as a tribute to a recently dead person. As for neutral point of view, I didn’t find testimonies contrary to the good reputation I reported for Liberati. To limit the “tribute feeling” that the article may transmit, I cut the last two paragraphs (on his work in Italy and on his networking role).

Hoping that this may help support the new submission, I send you my best regards  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
Jshapely, I do not think anyone has contested the notability of your subject, simply the general tone of the article.   Theoretically the Wikipedia should just report facts.   You may have looked at WP:NPOV.  Also related is WP:PEACOCK.   Let me look over your article this week end.   I have marked it as under review.   If I feel comfortable with the article, I will approve it for you.   If I am not so co",0,0,0,0,0,0

{{unblock|1=
Ruslik0 is incorrect in his block of me. I wasn't edit waring as defined by Wikipedia: I made one reversion of an edit today.

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.

 In response to Claude's last two posts.  Backwards of course.  Regarding NRMs - if you'll check the list, you'll see that Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, Foursquare, and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations.  Just a note.  Also true of the Vineyard Movement, of which there are many comparisons to GCA.  You're right that GCC doesn't like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were """"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art."""" and """"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.""""
 I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You're right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is """"GCAC is an association of churches"""".  That's what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that's what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let's start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.
 I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn't find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we're doing here - we're putting facts up.  We don't need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn't found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don't see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no """"typical view"""" - if we're going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don't have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.

I can't believe you would use the argument about it being """"truer"""" to the original color with regard to the background, but not mention that awful black stuff around the edges (as if that's somehow """"truer"""" to the original).  I'm also curious as to what method you used to compare the sharpness, since I merely compared them side by side, and saw that in crispness, they're identical.  Again, yours is larger, but that's because I deliberately used a smaller image because the Fair Use Rationale requires that such images be no larger than (IIRC) 300px.  Yours is labeled 300px in the Fair Use Rational Template ts image page, but that label is incorrect, because right below the image it says that it's 400 x 600-something. We're lucky some other editor or bot hasn't come and tagged it as inappropriate because of that.  That's why I used a 300px image, so I wonder if that's what you're basing this on.  Anyway, I photoshopped your version to remove the blackness at the edges, and the green smudginess from the lower half of the image, to make it more """"gold"""".  I also credited you on th e page to which I uploaded this newest version. I hope that's a good compromise. Thing is, since it's a modification of your image, it's still more than 300px, so let's hope we don't get tagged for it.  If we do, we'll have to put an Image Reduction Request tag on it.

Translation of AIDS quote
The original quote about AIDS is « Les sidaïques, en respirant du virus par tous les pores, mettent en cause l'équilibre de la nation. (…) Le sidaïque, – si vous voulez, j'emploie ce mot-là, c'est un néologisme, il est pas très beau mais je n'en connais pas d'autre –, celui-là, il faut bien le dire, est contagieux par sa transpiration, ses larmes, sa salive, son contact. C'est une espèce de lépreux, si vous voulez ». As a bilingual speaker, my translation would be more like:

""""The aids-ers, by breathing virus from every pore, put in question the balance of the nation(...). The aids-er - if you like, I use that word, it's a neologism (coining/solecism), it's not very pretty but I don't know any other-, that [person], it must be said, is contagious through his sweat, his tears, his saliva, his touch. He's somewhat like a leper, if you like.""""

He does not claim that it's a type of leprosy - 'c'est une espèce de lépreux' does literally mean '(he/she/it) is a type of leper' but is in fact a colloquial way of making an imprecise comparative. So, to summarise: he makes inaccurate statements about the means of transmission of HIV, and he compares people living with HIV to lepers/leper colonies as part of his advocacy for their forced internment.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

  It actually doesn't matter how good the information itself is, because even good information on Wikipedia cannot be trusted and therefore is not helpful. Anyway, it's well known that science coverage is better than humanities. The problem with situation like this is that you have people who seen to operate from a scientific mindset editing articles that have to do with literature, theology, culture, and philosophy. Most wikipedia admins mis-apply scientific concepts and criteria and methods to articles that are not subject to those methods. For instance, you constantly see idiotic admins asking for """"reliable"""" """"empirical"""" sources for a claim about literature, or asking for """"reliable"""" """"unbiased"""" citations for some postmodern topic. Hahaha. Anyway for philosophy at least we have the stanford encyclopedia. Right now the best compendium of information for information about the contents of books is on Amazon. Too bad that a greedy corporation gets to own and capitalize on all that free information. Wikipedia can't handle that stuff because any books that aren't the taste of these Richard Dawkinite Asperberger I-Fucking-Love-Science types get deleted. Like the Law of One article. Some pointy headed basement nerd decides he doesn't like those books so they should be deleted. Nevermind that they meet all the wikipedia requirements... what counts is that the admin thinks the books are """"nonsense"""" and that the 30+ notable and reliable sources are """"biased"""". And you can't get justice because there are way more dumb admins than good ones, and what kind of person would volunteer for such a terrible job anyway? The only people who become admins are power tripping losers with small man syndrome, because those are the only kind of people who benefit from the job. They don't follow the rules as laid out in wikipedia guidelines and there is no court or system to keep them accountable. The admin rot goes all the way to the top, and admins will never justify their rulings according to policy. It's like having a legal system where judges are not required to explain a ruling in legal terms. They just hand out the ruling without explaining how the ruling follows from law, and then they cry about it when people point out that there is no logical way to get from the written laws to the stupid ruling they made. They cry harassment. They delete your criticisms from their page. They delete the evidence you present. You claim this asshole is competent; why did he selectively delete the evidence I presented on his talk page? He deleted the EVIDENCE. That's not incompetence, that's malicious, that's psychopathic.

Do a Google search for the terms we are discussing and you will see there are over a million results online (a million!) showing the terms in articles about NLP.

You frequently mention rules such as WP:OR but NEVER discuss the merits of the facts.  Is that because the facts don't support your perspective?

FROM THE TIMES

""""The sudden loss of pressure in an airliner cabin, as occurred on the Ryanair flight, is a frightening and potentially painful experience for passengers but it is does not usually endanger the aircraft. Half a dozen episodes of rapid pressure loss have been suffered by airliners over the past year.

Pilots follow a standard procedure if the cabin pressure suddenly drops while at cruising altitude. They don the oxygen masks which are constantly at their shoulder and put the aircraft into an emergency descent to about 8,000ft above sea-level, the altitude at which the air becomes comfortably breathable.

At the same time the crew would have declared an emergency to the en-route air traffic control and requested immediate clearance to the lower altitude and landing at a nearby airport. In the meantime the oxygen masks will have deployed automatically to supply passengers and other crew during the descent.

The Ryanair Boeing 737 performed exactly this procedure after it suffered pressure loss. The pilots descended from about 35,000ft to 8,000ft in five minutes, according to the authorities at Limoges airport, where it landed. The media and passengers may call such manoeuvres a """"plunge"""" or a """"free fall"""", but the descent rate of about 5,600ft per minute is perfectly controlled and within the normal performance of the aircraft — assuming that all its flight systems are functioning.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Mughals 

Claiming that the Mughals were a Turkic people, and mentioning some odd Turkish name given to them (a name that does not appear in ANY historical or scholarly sources), is pure POV. 

The Mughals were neither Turks in ethnicity (they were originally Mongols, descening from the Timurid and other Chingizid families of Central Asia > Berlas Mongols), nor in language (starting with Humayun, they were certainly and evidently Persian-speakers; Akbar did not even know Chaghatay - he had to translate his grandfather's memos into Persian to read them! Later, the Mughals were evidently Urdu speaking!)

I do not know why certain users keep putting that POV paragraph into the article. They claim that it is sourced ... but not all sources are good. Why do they ignore the whole bunch of other, mostly authoritative sources (such as the works of Prof. B.F. Manz, THE leading expert on Timurid and Turco-Mongol history; see: B.F. Manz, """"Tīmūr Lang"""", in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Online Edition, 2006)?! They only stick to certain versions of the Britannica ... only those that suite them. They totally ignore other sections of Britannica that actually have a totally different opinion on the isse. For example this one:

""""... Baber: The first Mughal, or Mongol, emperor of India (1526–30) and founder of the Mughal Dynasty there was Baber. He also won distinction as a military commander, a gifted poet and diarist, a statesman, and an adventurer. As ruler of the principality of Fergana in Turkestan, his birthplace, Baber first tried to recover Samarkand, the former capital of the empire founded by his Mongol ancestor Timur Lang ..."""" 

The Columbia Encyclopaedia states:

''""""... Timur (timoor') or Tamerlane (tăm'urlān), c.1336–1405, Mongol conqueror, b. Kesh, near Samarkand. ..."""" 

The paragraph about the Mughals should be removed. Even IF some people believe that they should be listed, only because their FIRST ruler (Babur) wrote his memoires in Turkic, the paragraph should be removed because it's controversial. Memoires do not prove anything, especially in regard of the fact that Humayun's biography is written in Persian (by his sister Gulbadan Begum), and that Shah Bahadur II is known as one of the greatest Urdu poets! 

In no way the Mughals were a """"Turkic people"""" ... neither in origin, nor in ethnicity, culture, language, or influence.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.

""""Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who """"serve"""" the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan's 'comfort system', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men's access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.""""

a748710720cf8a17,"Losses and the Luftwaffe after the Battle of Britain 

In the 'Aftermath' section, it is noted:  In losses of aircraft and experienced aircrew, the battle was a blow from which the Luftwaffe never fully recovered. It had significantly fewer bombers at the start of Operation Barbarossa, some 929 machines, because of losses sustained over Britain.Bergström 2007, p. 129.

I am not sure if that is what Bergström, who is being referenced here, actually writes, as I do not have access to his books. I doubt it, however. The Luftwaffe frontline strenght certainly did not decrease as a result of the Battle of Britain, as reinforcements and production was more than sufficient to replace losses, and, to replace the existing types with more modern type of aircraft, withdrawing the older models (ie. by the start of Barbarossa, much of the 109E fleet was now replaced by the new 109F).

It is also contestable on grounds of Luftwaffe reported strenghts. Olaf Groehler, in 1975, for example reports the LW frontline strenght (not including a lot of aux. and non-combat oriented units) gives the LW strenght as 5298 on 11 April 1940 (before the Western Campaigns), of which 1356 were S-E fighters, 1711 being bombers and 414 being dive bombers. A day before Barbarossa, 21 June 1941, he reports 5599 aircraft, (ie. some 300 aircraft increase) including 1440 S-E fighters, another 263 in a new category, the night-fighters, 1511 bombers and 424 dive bombers. Therefore the claim that only 929 bombers were in the Luftwaffe (which I suspect is a misunderstanding of the original text) is wrong, as is the conclusion that this was due to some 'irreversible blow' suffered during the BoB. It may well be that 929 or so bombers were employed against Russia, while the others elsewhere in the West and in the Med. In any case, the claim that the BoB was some sort of a death blow to the LW lacks solid foundation. It certainly suffered considerable losses, as did the RAF which lost apprx. 100% of the fighter and bomber force it started the Battle with, but even in absolute terms those losses were not irrecoverable; the LW already lost about the same number of aircraft during the two months of the Battle of France as it did during the four months of the Battle of Britain; yet it was was capable of launching the BoB offensive just a month later, as it was capable of seizing complete air dominance over the Eastern front in 1941. Therefore I think that particular sentence is contenstable and should be removed.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Simon Charlton and Sealand national football team  

Four different users have now tried to add the fact that Simon Charlton played for the Sealand national football team to the infobox on his article, citing this article from the BBC. The text does not mention Charlton but I have not watched or listened to the video, so I don't know if he's mentioned. Be that as it may, IMO this was not a serious fixture and should not be added to the infobox. Any thoughts?      
Derek Stillie has had this info added too    
Should be treated like any other """"nation"""" not recognized by FIFA. If those are included, this should be too, as the NF-Board, who seems to be the next official thing, recognized this match. -  
Apparently Mr Charlton captained the side..... In my opinion, any """"governing body"""" that accepts membership from an attention-seeker representing a fort in the sea with a resident population of 3 whose football association advertises for members of the public worldwideto write in and apply to be a second-half substitute in a supposed """"international"""" match under said governing body's control, loses any possible credibility. I hope the ground where the match was played made a few quid behind the bar, but DK has it correct, it's not a serious fixture and shouldn't be in the infobox. A sentence in the prose is fine, but that's all. cheers,   
It was an official NF-Board recognised match. I don't know what that means in terms of notability but looking at players of other NFB """"national"""" teams, there's about a 50-50 split to whether their caps are mentioned in the infobox. Dom 
Regardless of what we normally do with NF-Board countries, I don't have a problem in removing Sealand from the infobox as aspecial case. We are after all talking about a country with no grass or artificial turf, and a population of fewer than 11 people. —WFC—  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 My first hand dissapointing experience with the movement == == 

I have been to several Larouche meetings and I find it very interesting that the Larouche Movement advocates that we non-members are conditioned by fear (especially baby boomers) not to join their fight when on the contrary they use nothing but catastrophic speculations as recruitment. Larouche has been propagating perpetual nuclear warfare and the collapse of the economy for decades. I have personally been told that I would work at Starbucks after my degree (I have a well paying successful job today), the economy will collapse within a year (this was told to me a few years ago), and I was shown pictures of soldiers being hanged referring personally to my faith if I had not joined their fight to stop it. 

You see, by joining this movement, members take a leap over all their earthly problems by being placed in purposeful positions to save the world and receive immortality of the soul in return. Which depressed kid would not want to be placed into that fantasy world. The lonely recruits receive brotherhood; the ones who have failed in life are given intellectual reverence surmounting any non-larouchie, that’s a good opiate receptor! Many of these recruits come into the movement as empty slates to be filled up with Larouche tactics, this is why the Larouche YOUTH Movement has been the biggest sector in their existence. This is also a reason Larouche recruiters blatantly challenge their contacts not to listen to their parents, professors, or any adults with the explanation that they have become forever impudent by fear through degenerate cultures that us kids still have a chance to overcome. 

1) They believe in aristocracy, as their beloved and foundation, Plato does. It's interesting how their cause is to invest in the potential of every single human mind when their political system would be setup to discount and make decisions for the non-aristocrats, which would be us weaklings. And before one of you fresh Larouchie's claims this is not true, it had been recorded in a briefing. 

2) They want you to drop out of school because classes are setup as a 1-way channel between teacher and students, rather than, a pedagogue where everyone can facilitate the exchange of diverse ideas. I find this most interesting when i was accused of being a British operative in my attempt to exchange the ideas of philosophers and economic theories they were never exposed to. During a meeting my questions were brushed off and not answered, the speaker called them ‘academic’. The Larouche Movement is so organized that he has already conditioned his youth to negate any wake-up theories or opposing ones to be that of British conspiracy against mankind. In conclusion, this is no place to exchange ideas as they preach it is, it’s exchanging Larouche ideas or nothing. 

3) Larouche writes thousands of pessimistic speculations, and when one inevitably hits, he is plumed to be always right as the others are forgotten. The speculations that are forgotten are thrown under the umbrella of economic collapse and perpetual warfare with only the future to hold the truth. Just read Larouche writings, he tells you that he is the ONLY ONE in the WORLD who can save us from these disasters. His intent and cause seem great, but what does his character tell you about the underpinnings; his Will to Impose himself on others? It is so blatant that even the purblind can see the egotistical style in his writings, remember, this is called the LAROUCHE Movement. 

4) Larouche recruiters insult your way of living opposed to the thinkers, the ones who spend their time developing their minds in the movement. If the Larouchie’s are our saviors, if they are the brains of our renaissance, or even the brains of the world, studying Larouche mathematics, science, literature, philosophy, politics. Well how come none of the members ever made an invention or real impact. They really can use some invention to boost their popularity and finances. The reason this has not occurred is a great irony; these members are not self thinkers, they are followers, they study only Larouche and even with that knowledge they are too conditioned for Larouche to make new inferences.  

All this studying and organizing only embeds the shackles on their minds. It is very unfortunate, because these members truly become psychologically stuck in the movement. It is very hard for one to admit to the Self that all these years were a waist of time and they must now step back to the miserable status of earthly life they left off at. This, accompanied with the fact that these members breathe Larouche 24/7, is why they will and are stuck beyond all fathomable realizations of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hey TParis, can you repost this to WP talk:RFA for me. Someone locked my IP for telling a couple of abusive admins off. Otherwise I'll find a way to do it later...never mind maybe I'll just change my IP again so I'll take care of it later.
Great catch, the one I was talking about was the broken link in RFA tools. I didn't even know about the other 2 you found so although you might think it was childish, the project benefited from you reviewing the templates. For what its worth, its also childish for the community to tell an editor who devoted years to the project they aren't trusted and that their edits must be reviewed by an admin to be implemented but then have the admins doing the change admit they wouldn't know if they were correct or not. Its childish to allow admins to abuse the system and generally hold them to a lessor standard of editquette but then treat editors like second class citizens in the site. There are tons of childish things going on within this site, but my decision to not do the work because the community doesn't trust the work I do, after doing it for years, isn't particularly childish. If there was more trust in this community I would still be a high output contributor and would have made that change to the RFA template back in July when I found it...along with a dozen others with other templates and the myriad of vandalism that still sits on articles in my watchlist (I assume, because I locked my account so now I can't see it). 108.45.104.158",0,0,0,0,0,0

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own.

If Wade wanted to waer a Yankees hat, the hall wouldnt have said anything because Wade played great for the Yanks and won a world series with them.  The point is Reggie Jackson did great things for both the New York Yankees and Oakland A's.  We the people should vote for whether the color is of the A's or the Yankees.  Even though everyone remembers Reggie as a Yankee and hardly anyone remembers him as an A.  Ever wonder why ESPN and all the sports channels show Reggie's Yankee highlights and not any A's highlights?  Reggie is a Yankee 4ever.

 classical optics part 2 

i hate to say this but i think everyone has completely misunderstood what i am tryint to do.

i am just trying to give a clear picture to the reader of the beginings and then move on to the other sections, i have no intention at all of changing the structure of the article. the article begins very clearly with the """"classical optics"""" part that describes how light was considered before the wave model. the problem our current presentation is that the wave model is right in the begining, this is a bit strange.

that is why i arranged the article such that you had the classical optics and its further explanation in geometrical optics, then wave modeln then comparison to quantum optics and finally modern optics. in other words nothing in the article changed except for the position.
copper i feel that in the sources you have shown they are considering classical optics as the entire thing which is both the particle and wave model. however what i am doing is showing the beginning of optics. there are other google hits that take classical optics purely as the earlier concepts before the introduction of wave model but anyway there is no point of going through them and listing them. one google book on fourier optics does not mention the word """"electromagnetism"""" till page 365! different terminology i guess. anyway 

i feel that we cant put the wave model in the beginning, it just would not make any sense. its like we are skipping everything and landing on maxwells equations which happened much later. the current form is ok. 

it follows a good pattern - classical, geometrical, wave model, comparison with quantum optics finally modern optics.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Oh really? Tell me, Dab, are you an atheist? You have to answer this question. How can you say that “It really shouldn't matter”? It matters! If you are a theist, you will try to say something negative about atheism. You will try to collect useless criticism of atheism from pro-religious websites.

Look, most theists don’t understand atheism properly. They have little knowledge about science and if they were to understand the meaning of reason and science, they will become atheists. Most theists cannot make a distinction between Intelligent Design and Evolution. They fail to understand why Intelligent Design is a pseudoscience and Evolution is a valid science. 

This is your opinion:
""""Try James Buchanan (minister), or more recently C. S. Lewis. Lewis was an atheist, became convinced of theism, and later became a Christian in particular. There can be no doubt that Lewis was an intelligent man. He has published on his views of theism.

Your views don’t seem to have a neutral point of view. You recommended me to study about C. S. Lewis. Is that neutral? C.S. Lewis was a Christian apologetics. And, I think his views were silly. C. S. Lewis was """"very angry with God for not existing"""". I am an atheist and I am not angry with God for not existing. I know that God does not exist.

It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions.

Actually, I don't think it's particularly 'enlightening' at all!  First, the essay implies that a person may be inclined to view a number of edits as coming from 'the same person'.  I view that implication as an example of a 'straw-man argument':  A person builds up an (intentionally weak or flawed) argument, solely for the purposes of knocking it down.  That's not particularly enlightening, except that it reveals that people generally have more luck knocking down a position if they've built it up, specially, just for that purpose.
I view the matter more as an example of a commonality of self-selection:  Consider that if you're at the top of El Capitan (natural rock pillar), you will find (generally) two types of people:   1.  Very rich people who can (and do) hire a helicopter to fly there.
2.  Very capable, enthusiastic, and competent rock climbers.
In other words, you don't find there many people who are both poor and handicapped, merely because of where you happen to be.  (and, if you're actually there, chances are that you, too, are either rich or a very good rock climber.  Wikipedia is, quite likely, a 'magnet' for 'control freaks'.  (and others, obviously.)  I've read comments that some editors make tens of thousands of edits.  While I could say, """"Get a life!"""", I don't view such enthusiasm as INHERENTLY bad, wrong, or a problem.  But, I think there may very well be an ASSOCIATION between OCD-type (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) editing, and 'control-freak' behavior.
There are other clues that must be considered.  A person who is acting out a 'control-freak' fantasy, wants to control as much as possible.  Apparently, WP has made it quite easy to 'revert'  to a previous edit.  That ability is not NECESSARILY bad (against vandals), but it implicitly encourages a kind of 'all or nothing' reaction:  If a 'control-freak' wishes to manipulate, as much (and as many) as possible, it's far easier to simply 'revert' ALL of an edit, rather than (carefully and selectively) remove ONLY as much of a 'problem' as actually exists.  Ever heard an old saying, """"When the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat all problems as if they were nails.""""  One of the most 'inefficient' routes, from the standpoint of a 'control-freak', is to actually stick around and dispute the propriety of the original edit, and the characteristics of the 'control-freak's actions. 
A 'control-freak' gets his jollies, most readily, by UNdoing what others have done.  (The 'control-freak' feels, explicitly or implicitly, that he doesn't have to 'justify' the status of the article BEFORE his victim's edit!).  If the 'control freak' must actually distinguish between 'proper' posting and 'improper' posting sections, he becomes far less 'efficient' at manipulating others.  (He must spend far more 'valuable' (in his not-so-humble opinion) time READING, and distinguishing, rather than merely reverting!   Consider a hypothetical 'war' between a person who is making a 'house of cards', and another person who views it as his task to impede the first:  The latter person needs merely show up for a second or two, every few minutes, and knock down the 'house of cards'.  Minutes or hours of work is gone, in a moment!  VERY 'efficient', from the standpoint of the 'control freak', but not for his victim.
 Worse, if the 'control freak' must first obtain a CONSENSUS (something which WP ostensibly requires) he is powerfully impeded from excercising his 'control-freak' tendencies.  (I am not considering, here, raw 'vandalism', of course:  Very arguably, it SHOULD be easy to completely revert actual, genuine 'vandalism'.)  It is not surprising, therefore, that 'control-freaks' are far more likely to simply revert ALL of an edit, QUICKLY, preventing consensus, and refusing to justify it in any actual discussion.
Thus, I notice that (in, so far, every case), every 'drive-by deletion' to which I have been a victim involves a person who REVERTS ALL of my edits (Check!), and not merely a portion of them (Check!) and who does so VERY quickly (Check!), who prevents any sort of consensus from forming (Check!), and who doesn't bother to stick around to debate the propriety of the original posting, or the 'freak's' abrupt erasures (Check!).
  Aha!  Things are getting quite clear, at least from the standpoint of the 'control-freak' in question.  But why should a flock of others try criticize the victim, and NOT the 'control freak'?  Is it because I think 'they're the same person'?  ('Straw-man argument')   Noooo!  Consider another saying, """"Birds of a feather flock together"""".   If there were only a single 'control-freak' in the world, nobody else would have any motivation to assist him, or to help victimize his victims.  But there are many 'control-freaks', and each understands that if ONE 'control freak' gets impeded, prohibited, or criticized, or exposed, the next one COULD BE THEM!  After all, I",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have read that particular book, and I'm confused by what you say. Of course the film jumps from person to person; the progression is of ideas, not poeple to be interviewed, which allows for a cohesive meaning to the film. In fact, the film presents information very similar to that of the book in question, except it is not essentially a propaganda piece aimed at one particular medium, but an exposé of an industry, targeted at the practices of several media.
I'm also a writer, and a prodigous reader. I had read most of Seuss' children's work by the time I was three, most of Dahl's children's stories by the time I was six, and read The Lord of the Rings when I was twelve. I was in the tenth percentile of the state in my final year of school literature exam. When you can read Metamagical Themas, The Silmarillion and The Gods Themselves at the same time and take any meaning away from them, you can have a go at being condescending.  17:36",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello. You appear to be involved in an edit war on User talk:Borvo .

While the three-revert rule is hard and fast, please be aware that you can be blocked for edit warring without making 3 reverts to an article in 24 hours. You are not entitled to 3 reverts and edit wars may be slow-moving, spanning weeks or months.  Edit wars are not limited to 24 hours.

If you are unclear how to resolve a content dispute, please see dispute resolution.  You are expected to cooperatively engage other editors on talk pages rather than reverting their edits.  Note that posting your thoughts on the talk page alone is not a license to continue reverting. You must reach consensus.  

If you feel your edits might qualify as one of the small list of exceptions, please apply them with caution and ensure that anyone looking at your edits will come to the same conclusion.  If you are uncertain, seek clarification before continuing.  Quite a few editors have found themselves blocked for misunderstanding and/or misapplying these exceptions.  Often times, requesting page protection or a sockppuppet investigation is a much better course of action.

 Ettlinger Being Jewish + His Family 

Hi all,

I learned about Adrian’s death after a web search yielded this Wikipedia article (see my post of """"In Memoriam"""" about him to the Freecell Solving Discussions mailing list), and since he was a good Internet friend of mine, and we corresponded extensively on E-mail, I’d like to help with the English Wikipedia article about him. In any case, Ettlinger told me in a private E-mail that he was Jewish (at least by descent - he wasn’t an observant/religious Jew and said something about being a deist), and so I think his article should be added to the American Jews by occupation category. One problem I see there is that I don't see any sub-category for Jewish American Engineers and/or Jewish American software developers (he was both). I know that Richard Stallman is a Jewish (also only by decent) American software developer, and he belongs to the categories """"American computer programmers"""" and """"American Jews"""" and there are naturally many others. I have kept most of the E-mails with him, so can upload them in part to my web-site or elsewhere for citation, nut will it be considered a self-reference? So what should be done?

Adrian also told me about his family (two children if I remember correctly, and four or five grandchildren, all but one are attending university now), but I don't think he mentioned any names. Should they be mentioned as well?

I'll try to improve the entry about him in other respects. Thanks to all the Wikipedia editors who wrote what exists up to now based on the research.

 Comment from IP 

I was a Sophmore in High School when the 37th division was sent to the South Pacific theater of war. Three years later, in May, 1945, I was a replacement joining this Division where I earned my combat badge in June of that year. June 30th did not see the end of combat for this Division. I was an 18yr. old replacement and a member of Company D, 145th Infantry Regiment when we were sent deep into the Cagahan(Sp?) Valley of Northern Luzon with the assignment to thwart the fleeing soldiers of Japan from reaching the dense forested hills bordering that Valley. Our Company was engaged in many firefights with these retreating Japanese army units. My last combat missions were ended soon after the Dropping of the atomic bombs on the Japanese main land in early August. While my combat experience was very limited, I did come face-to-face with my own mortality during these few months of combat experience. When I came home in 1946, I remember the resentment I felt that my parents had to come with me before I could register to vote in my first National election. I was still under the legal voting age of 21.

On another subject, the Name of Medal of Honor winner, John J. Petrarcal is new to me. There is a famous ballad about the only Medal of Honor Winner about whom I had ever read, and that Medal of Honor went to Pvt.Roger Young, 148 Infantry Division,37th Division  for bravery on the Island of New Georgia, in the Solomon Islands in May of 1942.

I in no way want to detract from John Petrarcal, but I wonder, are there possibly two heroes to recall?   Citations: Personal experience and 37th Division written History.

Hi Codman. We have been through this before. Making highly emotive and subjective remarks in article is not appropriate for wikipedia.

I don't disagree with any of the points you are making but I will continue to tone down emotive remarks and remove opinions as they have no place here.

If you have facts then cite them. Commenting on research then saying 'therefore we must' is not encylopedic, it is your (probably correct) opinion. Saying something is criminally inadequate is rubbish as otherwise where are the legal proceedings?

Okay let me point out that in these lines, from Khatai, the first verse: three words are Persian (Beh Naameh Khodvand) and two words in Arabic (Hayy Karim) .  The second verse has two Turkish words Kim, Dur and three Arabic words (Aval, Zaat Qadim) and one Persian word (Tavanaa).  Not the Arabic words are also not straight from Arabic but filtered through Persian and have taken really different meanings than their original Arabic.  They have taken Persian words.  Now did somebody 500-600 impose Persian words on Khatai?
How about Nasimi.  Note the verse I brought, there is no Turkish words except the word """"Bu"""".  Arsh, Korsi, Har, Do, 'Alem, Hami, Kerdar, Mast are Persian or Arabic.

Of course it doesn't have sockpuppet tags on. It's brand new, created for the sole purpose of vandalization. It's somebody breaking the rules. And BTW, I was not being uncivil. It wasn't a threat, it was a very specific promise of how I would follow up with his continued disruption, and I will.  You are being uncivil by continuing to harrass me, and also unreasonable in thinking somehow a sockpuppet created for the sole intention of vandalization actually can have its feelings hurt. This is what I would at this point consider the end of the discussion. Anything else would be a sign of uncivility.  
I'm not being remotely uncivil. I left a message and asked you not to be. You've now continued your uncivil behaviour by blanking warnings from your talk page. Promise or threat amounts to the same uncivil behaviour. There was no reason to threaten them with an IP ban. 
You are attacking me with warnings and attempting to set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner so you can complain about me, probably to subvert the vote for deletion against the Michael Everson article. You responded to my warning the vandal about his vandalism so quickly, it raises my suspicion that it may be in retaliation for my very quick reversion of the vandalism that occured at the AfD. You are behaving in such a manner that seems to be attempting to troll me by continued action after being warned to leave me alone. I disagree with you plainly that I behaved uncivily. It is not required of me to agree with you. I also consider your warning of me behaving uncivily a personal attack and am removing it. 
If you want to find an arbitrator for arguing over nothing, that is directly your next step as per the arbitration guidelines.   
Leaving a warning template for obviously uncivil behaviour isn't uncivil. Otherwise no one could leave them. Retaliating with that template however is uncivil. I've pointed out the issue with your behaviour, you can correct it or not, but launching a personal attack against me won't help you. As for the AfD you're involved in, I could care less, I have no interest in it. 
And again I'll remind you: You are in charge of how you behave and respond. """"set me up for behaving in an uncivil manner"""". If you behave uncivily, its your fault, no one else's. No one has held a gun to your head to force you to act in the manner you are.

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?

As stated the first time,  """"no (editing) of an article related to anything political in Vaughan, no AfDs, RfDs, Deletion Reviews, talk page editing and vandalism, endless article edits and reverts"""" are to be allowed.

There are no exceptions. Anything that you are involved in on Wikipedia that has to do with something or someone in Vaughan should stop totally. That includes the RfD. That doesn't mean you have to remove it, but just leave it alone. Trust the admins. 

Leotardo, I thank you for agreeing with this proposal in principle. I'm glad you are willing to participate in the process. I agree with your ends. So to Pm_shef: you must agree to concede the two concerns Leotardo has, in the spirit of co-operation.

Pm_shef mentioned the Susan Kadis article that he wanted to research for; but though the 10 hour time expired, there are still no such edits. I'm sure it doesn't mean that he isn't taking this process seriously. 

So Pm_shef and Leotardo, and myself, we have 10 hours before all the editing noted above will totally cease. Pm_shef is to add his objective Kadis research, and Leotardo will have his two edits added, before the 10 hours expires. I will go and do that now.

 Semi-protected edit request on 8 January 2014 

Please remove this page from my Facebook page.  This is not
my high school nor did I teach at this high school.  Thank you,  Jude Johnson

  
  Not done: please be more specific about what needs to be changed.   

 Use in Belgium and The Netherlands.. way off. 

Not only does the paragraph not explain the """"Hogeschool"""" (literal translation) system that provides Associate and Bachelor degrees, the information it provides about secondary education is wrong in some key points. Since I can't directly edit, I thought I might sum it up here.

Children are required to attend school from 6 to 18 in Belgium and 5 to 18 in The Netherlands or until they attain a specific level of education (BE: any secondary education, NL: HAVO, VWO or a level 2 MBO). See Dutch government website on 'leerplicht' and Flemish regional government's page on the same subject. Not relevant for Hogeschool, but faulty info in the article nontheless.

Dutch MBO is not considered school for the first two years, it is always considered school (unlike a """"Hogeschool"""", that functions as a University in terms of application, funding etc).

Now I don't know exactly how the Flemish equivalent of Hogeschool/High-school is used, but i'll sum up how it works in the Netherlands from the lowest level up until Hogeschool (usually translated as """"University of Applied Sciences""""). I'll skip internal stuff on VMBO and MBO, basically VMBO level determines MBO starting leve and you can always go up a MBO level(1-4) if you want to spend the time.

MBO level 4 provides access to almost all(1) Hogeschool Associate (120 ECTS) and Bachelor (240 ECTS) programs. Associate degrees are more of a technicality, unknown to employers and unused in most programs, but they exist.
Completing the first year (also known as Propedeuse) of a Hogeschool program grants access to almost all(1) University Bachelor programs.

1)Additional requirements may be set, usually involving math or language courses attended.

Hogescholen (and Universities) must offer access to their Associate and Bachelor programs to potential students aged 21 and up via 'Colloquium Doctum'. Here's some more info from a Dutch University in English on that subject, including a reference to the article of Dutch law about 'Colloquium Doctum'. The same system is often used when potential students lack certain courses from previous studies.

Regarding the article as a whole, it seems to lack sources overall, I feel it should be open for editing or otherwise overhauled to apply only to the term """"high school"""" and it's literal translations, redirecting to articles about secondary/higher education if needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.171.32.96   

 Is high school in comics a valid category? About half of super hero's are teenagers. 

I think this is as valid a category as zoos in fiction; these are both settings that are only really told by specific kind of stories. Teen and animal adventure.   

:Category:Fictional schools and its subcategory Category:Superhero schools already exist.   

Teenaged superheros are not fictional schools. They might be fictional high school students and or fictional teenagers. In many cases, however, those will not be defining characteristics. - [[User:SummerPhD|Summer",0,0,0,0,0,0

Commenting on the evidence, I would like to assert which were done by me and which were not (I don't really know what to do, or what I can do, in these sort of situations, so this is all I can offer right now). Evidence 1,3,4, and 5 were done by me, and evidence 2,6, and 7 were not. Evidence 1 was me making an edit (logged in) to the page Aang, as I often make small edits to pages I am familiar with. Evidence 2 was not me, as I do not use profanity. Evidence 3 was me (logged in) following the guidelines given to me as I faced a block message, and the aforementioned guidelines were to paste a link on my page to remove the block. Now this is where I am a bit confused. Evidence 4 was me (NOT logged in) removing the Welcome! template that was on my user page, but I did this a few weeks ago (I believe that date listed is July 25). I removed it because I felt I no longer needed it and generally dislike it when my page is not edited by me, which I assume led to Evidence 5. Evidence 5 was me (logged in) removing the Unblocked message from my page, and although I do not know what """"snarky"""" is (I hope it isn't an insult), I removed the template, again, because I generally dislike it when other people edit my page (I understand that in this situation the edit to my page was to alert me of the unblock, but I was assuming that message would be sent via inbox rather than a direct edit). As for Evidence 6 and 7, I am not user Hermanthegerman66, and I would guess that IP 24.7.247.203 is also Hermanthegerman66 but not at the library.

AFC Creation
Please take a look at the articles created that were deleted.  Some of the sources I had previously used were not what they consider to be reliable sources.  After the non reliable sources were mentioned to me, I stopped using them.  I started to only use sources that appeared on google news or on google books.  I have even gone to the reliable sources noticeboard to see if sources were good to use.   The SPI wasn't frivolous as a number of editors were previously investigated as being members of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Papaursa/Archive     Other admins (. St★lwart111) have stated that there were problems in WP:TAGTEAM .   specifically    Most of my articles are about individuals who were are notable via wiki standards such as African Americans sports players during segregation James “Pappy” Ricks, Olympians such as Thomas Martin (judoka) or National Champions such as Howard Fish.   
With 140 articles about 9 have been deleted.  This isn't a horrible percentage. This is under 10%.  Considering that most of the individuals who were deleted were African American Judo fighters, I pointed out that statistic, to which they claimed I claimed I said they were racist or bigoted.  I never stated anyone was a racist or a bigot.  I pointed out a statistic.  After this issue was closed, one user tried to revive the issue, to which an admin stated """". Systemic bias is a recognized issue on Wikipedia""""    Some of the deleted articles, I am waiting for more sources to appear such as Al Gotay, which was speedily deleted even I replied to a prod, another user wrote another message stating it should be deleted (it never even made it to AFD).  
I have previously used Articles for Creation , but the backlog is so big that it is frustrating to use.   I did say, I create so others can work.  Meaning we all have skills that can be used on wikipedia.  To me an article is like building a car on a production line.  I put in the headlights, others put on the wheels, others put on the seats, etc.   I don't own any articles I create.  I rarely revert edits.  I find topics of individuals whom I believe are noteworthy and create them.  I look at some guidelines like [WP:WPBB/N]] and create articles from there (such as Negro League Baseball players or WP:NHOOPS such as players in the New York Rens    You did notice some of the bullying , and there is a lot the , such as I put in bogus claims , but I put in a simple explanation   and  
find additional sources .  I have improved in my article creation and firmly believe that if you put me on a creation ban, I will simply retire from wikipedia out of sheer frustration.  I am not disruputing wikipedia actively or passively, I am creating articles that for most people are notable and according to wiki standards are notable.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Turkish newspaper Hurrieyt reported over the weekend that Erdinc Tekir, who was hurt during the IDF raid on the boat, was among the ninemember team that hijacked the Black Sea ferry to bring the 1996 war in Chechneya to the world’s attention. Tekir spent some three and a half years in prison for the incident.

 Adding material, citations, general cleanup and resolving dispute 
I have painstakingly documented Warren Farrell's biography and professional discourse, supporting my edits with citations. In the Myth of Male Power, he endorses the concept of a ‘gender transition movement‘ as an alternative to either a ‘women's movement‘ or ‘men's movement‘. He has maintained this position since the book's publication in 1993, and has continued to promote the notion in every book published since. Additionally, I cannot find a single original, citable source to support use of the term masculinist being applied to him. As such, I have removed references to this non-neutral term.

I hope anyone watching this page will agree that I have enhanced the quality of this article tremendously. I am going to remove the request for cleanup and the neutrality dispute since I don't see any recent, active discussions that will remain unaddressed with the addition of the careful citations I have added.

(previous content:)
Warren Farrell (born 1943) is an American masculist author.

Farrell holds an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Political Science (UCLA; New York University (NYU)). He has taught at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, and at Georgetown University, Rutgers, Brooklyn College, and American University.

With the publication of The Myth of Male Power, Farrell became one of the first masculists. The term is difficult to precisely define, but in his case masculism is a form of celebrating men as no less than women, and rejecting any sexism displayed against men by women. Since the early 1970s, he has been a champion of feminism, serving on the board of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Within a few years, he was asked to leave NOW as his views diverged from those generally held in the organization; most specifically, he was critical of what he saw as female exclusiveness and disregard for men's issues. His early books The Liberated Man and Why Men Are the Way They Are were more in the vein of a type of men's liberation–an approach to men's issues similar to that of feminism to women's issues. These texts were not critical of feminism.

Farrell's critics declare him to be sexist and have an anti-woman attitude (or misogynistic). However, despite his being broadly attacked by many latter-day feminists including Susan Faludi.  In answering his critics, Farrell argues that his approach is essentially of equality and humanism. 

His approach to gender issues has come to be the cornerstone of masculism. His ideology calls for gender equivalence and, unlike some other masculists, a reduction in traditional gender roles. He has made a critical examination of the power imbalance between the sexes, claiming that in some cases it favors women: """"The women's movement had done a wonderful job of freeing women from sex roles, but no one did the same for men"""". 

Farrell was a candidate for governor in the 2003 California recall election. He came ninety-seventh out of 135 candidates. 

On May 27, 2005 Farrell appeared on John Stossel's """"Give Me A Break"""" segment of 20/20 to discuss, in his view, why men earn more. In the report he is seen speaking before the Cato Institute. He asked members of the audience to stand if they worked at least two years at a job meeting certain criteria: jobs which exposed them to wind and rain or long hours, for example. It was almost entirely men who stood.

Some suggest that the Cato Institute event had been staged to promote Farrell's books and opinions. Nonetheless, the event served to illustrate one of Farrell's key points - that women tend to choose, and are generally encouraged by the popular press to choose, jobs that are socially fulfilling rather than monetarily fulfilling. For instance, men are encouraged to work well-paid, long-hours jobs, whereas women are encouraged to search for jobs that allow them more time with their children or are seen as socially pleasant, involving little physical labour or serious physical unpleasantness. These jobs, across the board, tend to be paid less than the former. In addition, men are more likely to do overtime (and are of course encouraged to do so) than women, so necessarily get paid for more hours worked.

The restored wording seems over-simplified.  It ignores the Council's attribution to the college of the bishops of the same powers that it attributes also to the Pope alone.  The Pope has within the college or body of the bishops a position analogous to that which Peter had within the college or body of the apostles.  It was to the college or body of the apostles, with Peter as its head, that Christ gave authority over the Church.  It is the college or body of the bishops, with the Pope as its head, that has succeeded to that authority.  Schreck does not deny this.  The Pope's position needs to be mentioned, but the position of the bishops as a body must also be mentioned.    
Thank you for your comments. Do you have a reference for your position above? I just want the article to be factually correct so I am using the information provided in the Nihil obstat Imprimatur declared source by Prof. Alan Schreck which states on page 159 (author cites Lumen Gentium 22 and Catechism para 882 for the following): """"For the Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered."""" That seems pretty clear to me and supports the article text in the lead describing him as the leader of the church. The information about the college of bishops is discussed the section entitled Teaching Authority. I think that info is too detailed for the lead especially since that power is confined to defining doctrine.   '''talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

No, what you said before was that the term """"is not used in Ireland"""".  You're now admitting it is used - if rarely (I happen to agree with you there!).  Government policy doesn't cover geography.  And as demonstrated, government policy doesn't appear to cover FF senators and TDs (but then, that's not new...).  AFAICR, the Dept of Education essentially said """"Not our problem"""" when a teacher (?) complained to them about Folens using the BI term in its atlas and told the complainant to get in touch with the publishers directly.  To me, what smacks of a post-colonial inferiority complex is the drive by a vocal minority to expunge the term from every Irish-related article.  I rarely if ever use the term myself in everyday life (I prefer Ireland and Britain or Britain and Ireland), but if it does get used - meh!  Big deal!  I don't think it as a conspiracy to undermine sovereign Ireland, put us down, offend us, somehow claim our territory or subsume us back into the union, the way some people on here seem to take it.  Britain and Ireland, though, isn't a geographical term - its two different islands!

 The precise definition of race is under dispute 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 One Addition 

Mustafaa, I promised much more stuff but have been too busy lately.
One thing that sticks out and could be fixed quickly is the beginning of the invasion.
Yes, it is my fault for adding only the Argov incident, which now makes it sounds as if it was the main reason for invasion, which is of course wrong. So, the sentence:
 """"On 1982-06-06 Israel invaded Lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov by Abu Nidal in London on June 4.""""
should be expanded. This is a quickie list of basic facts:
 Israel had been bombing Lebanon/PLO for months, from the air, sea and land; and preparing for the invasion (see below, they couldn't have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise.)
 There was the attempted assassination Shlomo Argov ...
 The assassination attempt was used by Begin as an impetus to shortcut the Knesset's debate and move into Lebanon without full approval. 
 Israel invaded with 60,000 troops.

You're conflating issues here. This is not an assumption of bad faith; it's adhering to what the source actually says. William M. Connolley's extemporaneous comments here are not a source; the publication (RealClimate) is the source.

This is just a frank evaluation of what the source says; RealClimate says nothing about who worked on the article or how it was written, but we know that unsigned """"group"""" pieces are often not equivalent to joint authorship. For another analogy, consider per curium legal opinions. """"Per curium"""" means that all of the judges or justices agreed, but it's a very different thing from all of them signing the opinion. Typically, they're less controversial cases, so one judge's clerk writes the opinion, then they're circulated for comment. But the other judges typically don't scrutinize it as closely as if their name was on the line; there are many examples of judges railing against dicta that they theoretically endorsed just a couple of years earlier—sometimes even within the same case. Unanimous opinions (where every judge signs) are different, and they reflect a higher level of collaboration, as in Brown v. Board of Education. 

The bottom line is that the source itself doesn't say who wrote it. The commentators on BLP/N seem to think this is an important distinction.  Luke """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I have  read various pieces by Dr Mehdi Khaz'ali and listened to various  interviews with him, and must say that he comes over as a fantasist. He  just says things that some people badly want to hear, and that seems to  be the only thing that keeps him afloat in the media. Regarding Mr  Ahmadinejad not having served in the War, it is not true, but from a  technical point of view Mr Khaz'ali's story may contain some element of  truth. The fact is that Mr Ahmadinejad was not fighting as a regular  army soldier or officer, but was working party as a military logistic  engineer and partly as a military intelligence officer from behind  enemy's line. If my memory is not failing, during the War years he spent  some time in Kirkuk,  Iraq, amongst members of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan or Kurdistan  Democratic Party of Iraq  - both groups  were fighting alongside Iran against Saddam Hossein. The fact that after  the War he, i.e. Mr Ahmadinejad, became the Deputy to Governor-General of Maku  and Khoy  (West Azarbaijan Province has a sizeable Kurdish  population), and later Advisor to Governor-General of Kurdistan,  have direct relationship to his War-time experience in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Thus, indeed Mr Mohsen Rezai may not have been technically wrong in  saying that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been """"at the front"""" (assuming that  indeed the alleged statement is due to Mr Rezai), but to say that Mr  Ahmadinejad has lied about his War efforts, is just a false and  defamatory statement. Let us assume for a moment that Mr Ahmadinejad has  lied about his War efforts. Is it at all conceivable that a young man  from Tehran would get so early on so high up in the highest  administrative offices of Maku, Khoy and Kurdistan, from all places?

Hitler's words, private and official, about Rosenberg reflect the attitude of every strongman everywhere towards the philosophy that he puts to his use. If Hitler would have had a DIFFERENT attitude towards Rosenberg and his philosophy, THAT would have been noteworthy. The same goes for the quip about the U-boat crews. It tells us a lot about books but nothing about Rosenberg's book.

Is Samurai Champloo important enough to be included in this article? It doesn't seem to add much to the article. Why's every article I look at have some reference to anime?

Why does every other article I read have reference to some American Sitcom or other live-action medium? It's a part of popular culture, that's why. The Sunflower Samurai as well as Sunflowers themselves are a HUGE central plot point that dominates almost every single episode.

So post it in the Samurai Champloo article. Anime is not central nor even moderately relevant to actual sunflowers.

Because there is so much overlap between where they appear in the series and where they appear in the albums I did it this way.

 Since we are citing the Constitutions definition, it is of fundamental relevance to state that Sikhs did not accept the Constitution itself. The reason they did not accept it is because minority rights were not protected (because the Constitution did not even recognize the minorities to be separate from Hindus.)

 Borges' Apocryphal Quote 

Is """"apocryphal"""" the correct word.  In Royce's The World and the Individual, available on Archive.org, he begins a discussion (in the Supplemental Essay) as follows: """"let us suppose, if you please, that a portion of the surface of England is very perfectly levelled and smoothed, and is then devoted to the production of our precise map of England. That in general, then, should be found upon the surface of England, map constructions which more or less roughly represent the whole of England, — all this has nothing puzzling about it. Any ordinary map of England spread out upon English ground would illustrate, in a way, such
possession, by a part of the surface of England, of a resemblance to the whole. But now suppose that this our resemblance is to be made absolutely exact, in the sense previously defined.""""  Royce goes on for awhile.

Borges may have massaged, and shortened considerably, the quote, but the idea is still Royce's (it is also discussed in Russell's Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy).

This essay presents a critical, but insightful and vigorous character sketch that I think should be incorporated into the article. A passage:
TAB
TAB
Having come to power saying that her agenda was to pare down Wasilla to ‘the basic necessities, the bare bones’, she surprised its citizens when she redecorated the mayor’s office at a reported cost of $50,000 salvaged from the highways budget; its new red flock wallpaper matched her bold, rouge-et-noir taste in personal outfits. Another $24,000 of city money went on a white Chevy Suburban, known around Wasilla, without affection, as the mayormobile. She hired a city administrator to deputise for her in the day-to-day running of Wasilla’s affairs and employed a lobbyist in DC to wheedle lawmakers into meeting the town’s ever-expanding list of claims for congressional ‘pork’ (so named from the antebellum custom of rewarding slaves with barrels of salt pork). That expenditure, at least, paid off: during Palin’s six-year tenure as mayor, the federal government doled out more than $1000 for every man, woman and child in Wasilla. Her pet project was a $14.7m ice rink and sports complex, which opened in 2004. It is said to be lightly used, it has left the city servicing a massive debt, and a Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit continues over the bungled way in which Palin acquired the land on which it’s built.TABCut, Kill, Dig, Drill London Review of Books Vol. 30, No. 19, 9 October 2008, pages 7-10, Jonathan Raban 24.17.191.27

This one as well: 'Watermelon Roll': More Racism from 'Team Sarah' —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.17.191.27   

I'm not convinced that these commentaries would be of use to the article; aren't they opinion pieces? Albeit, in the case of the Raban article, from a respected and highly distinguished author.  If some of the meat was found in RSs it would be more worthy of consideration, methinks. Certain cuts from the joint may have already been served in one or other of the SP articles but I can't be arsed to check. There's so much verbiage. —   TAB

Ok, here's the God's honest truth:

It was however pretty rude. Did you really not notice?

Nope. I thought it was a generally polite critique

Btw, as it says on the FAC page, new nominations go at the top. 

I can't say I read that bit too closely

Don't you see anything wrong with bouncing yours up to upstage newer noms, with extra attention as the top post and extra time on FAC before your article """"rolls off""""? 

I didn't think about it thqat much

1) What was your purpose in moving the nomination to the top?  

So that it hot more attention and constructive critisism.

did you notice Worldtraveller moved your nomination back down with a rather tight-lipped edit summary?

No. I never ventured to read the history page

Johnleemk also warned you that he considered your """"playful jibe"""" a personal attack. 

I would like to point out that I was quick to correct him

C'mon, the place for """"playful jibes"""" like that is in interchange with friends who're used to your tone and will (I presume) enjoy it! It's just foolish to hurl them at strangers, and even more foolish to keep it up when they show they've taken umbrage.

cf7ab8e72c1070f1,"Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species.

Letter to User:Zoe

The world of Wikipedia is not what it should be and would be if people would not INITIATE personal attacks while correcting possible or actual violations of The Five Pillars of Wikipedia. The first round of Word Wars against me began all because I dared write about myself an article. Sure, call it self-promotion, but self-aggrandizement it is not. I was not fully aware of the rules then, but the fact is that there are people, not unlike myself, who are worthy of mention on Wikipedia, have sufficient write-ups, press coverage throughout the years or were a significant phenomena at a time, but who: a) cannot afford to hire PR and Publicity firms to have someone write about them on Wikipedia or b) would not impose upon their prominent friends to do so! Wikipedia should have a Special Cases Department, just as government should, were certain exceptional individuals can have their day in """"Wiki Court"""", and have a determination made by a """"Wiki Jury"""" as to whether or not they deserve a mention in Wikipedia. In any case, Alec Wilkinson, of New Yorker magazine fame, intends on writing an article about me for Wikipedia, partly out of fairness, since there is mention of Amy Alkon and her two partners in plagiarism. Amy Alkon, Advice Goddess, was one of the Three Free Advice Ladies. They read my write-up in The New Yorker and attempted to become famous at my expense! Until that time my life as The Free Advice Man was quite fulfilling, and I managed to help many people, including some on the verge of suicide. You may want to visit www.infinitysociety.org/FREEADVICEMAN.html to get the full story. Why does this matter?? Because, while it is true that I may have violated Wiki Rules in the past, which I no longer seek to do (as of Tom Harrison's warning), Wikipedia could benefit from an eccentric contributor. Yes I was and I am very angry to find that there are Wikipedians who will make unscientific statements about another person's intellectual accomplishments and worth.  Yes it is likely that there are people who go too far in enforcing the NO ORIGINAL CONTENT pillar. I am astounded that no one ever cared then (neither User:Trovatore, User:MikeTwo, or any of the current Wikipedians involved in this case) or now to make a sincere effort to contact Prof. Miklos Hernadi at The Hungarian Academy of Sciences, who will verify my status as a philosopher and who is aware of media reports in Hungary about my life as a philosopher from 1994 to 2002, including a published book of mine for which he wrote a Peer Review (he has a Ph.D.). And should Alec Wilkinson submit an article about me there should be no reason for it to be deleted. 

Look, I am 42 years of age and more European than American. Maybe Wikipedia is age-blind, but people who are younger, and perhaps less accomplished in life, should take the other person's age into consideration and communicate in a respectful and polite manner. If you analyze the whole matter, and if you are seriously interested in objectivity and making the world a better place, then you may yet come to the understanding that I never initiated any attacks, even though I did overreact at times. Also, about anti-Semitism... When someone attacks me, who really does not know me, my life's story and the reasons why the media has covered me, and dares claim that I am practically a """"nobody"""" then my reactions are perfectly understandable and given that the strong appearance of malice exists, why should I, as a Jew, not conclude, especially about persons who openly admit strong Christian identities with Christian groups that have a known track record for being anti-Jewish. Maybe CRCulver is not aware of his hate for the concept of infinity, which is my specialty and to which I profess my intellectual support for. Maybe he is not an anti-Semite, but he sure did not communicate to me (right from the beginning) as one would normally expect. As for promoting certain views and ideas; most Wikipedians and people working on Wikipedia do this all the time! Some more subtly than others. 

Anyway, you've blocked me indefinitely... Who benefits?? Look: I never went around looking to insult Wikipedians over their violations or mistakes; I never deleted information (because I think that there should be people in Wikipedia assigned for that sort of thing, and those should not be the same as those who add information!!!); .....in fact, come to think of it, that is a great idea! People who do the verifying of facts should not be those who write them...separation of Wikipowers!.... Anyway, adding an article titled """"Infinitology"""" is not violating the """"NO ORIGINAL CONTENT"""" pillar, because nowhere in that article did I talk about my name or my identity (other than being the author), and in fact talked about such prominent individuals, living and deceased, as Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Giordano Bruno, Baruch Spinoza, etc.... Anyway,",0,0,0,0,0,0

Our history

In 2008, The Economist conducted in-depth studies of its audience and what they discovered surprised them. What they have in common is the way they think.  They are intensely curious, they think globally and their ideas help move the world forward.  We call them Ideas People.

Ideas People Advocacy Network is a subset of Ideas People Channel – premier publishers of U.S Political content including CSMonitor, The Weekly Standard and Talking Points Memo. The Advocacy Network delivers more reach than Huffington Post and Politico and is the perfect tool for any advocacy campaign aimed at political influencers who are active on both the national and local level.

I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.

You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone """"producing"""" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are """"in it for the money"""", yet:

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are """"producing"""" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another """"compatible"""" (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the """"substitute"""" puppy you decide to offer them.
(see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....""""New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements"""").

It appears that, once monies are given are given to you, your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances, nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you """"produce"""" who display congenital/hereditary problems requiring resulting astronomical/extensive veterinary fees.
  
You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you """"produce"""" them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog's new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. 

You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own personal policy/commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you """"produce"""", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or in abusive situations.

Your """"Policies and Prices"""" make no mention of a contractual requirement by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new """"pets"""", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.
 
Your website does not list any independent references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), and your own",0,0,0,0,0,0

However, there are newspaper reports, which confirm, that the classical language category was introduced by constitutional decree. So this is enough to prove it:

http://www.deccanherald.com/CONTENT/Aug142008/editpage2008081384442.asp

Also i found a conversation of the Indian parliament, which illustrates the importance of the classical language status for India, where Mr. Shivraj V. Patil compares the status of the scheduled languages to the status of the classical languages:

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: Sir, the demand for declaring Kannada as a classical language is pending before the Government since 2004. The same answer has been given earlier also. My submission before the House is that the Kannada text and recorded history belongs to 252 BC. The first Kannada literary work Kavirajamarga was created in 850 AD and it refers to some writings earlier than that. The 12th Centaury Kannada Bhakti Movement in the form of Vachana or oral expression is unparallel. In contemporary kirtana which subsequently became Karnataka Sangeet is an enduring contribution to Indian music. Sir, the epigraphical material in Kannada, numbering over 25,000 inscriptions in stone and copper, are rich in style and contents, which are not found even in Tamil inscription. The UNESCO records Kannada amongst the prime scripts of the world. Sir, Kannada is among the first living languages of the world in the history of continuous writing system spanning three millennium like Hebrew, Chinese and Tamil.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY (CONTD): Sir, the recognition was given to Tamil. We do not grudge it. Now, Sir, when the world recognises Kannada, in India...

MR. CHAIRMAN: Please, put your question.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: ...step-motherly treatment is being given to Karnataka. Agitations are going on in Karnataka. About three days back, about one lakh people gathered. Everyday, it is going on. Has the Government recognised this? Is the Government going to take any action on this, and by what time?

SHRI SHIVRAJ V. PATIL: Sir, Kannada is a very rich language, ancient language. The matter is before the Committee of Linguistic Experts
constituted by the Ministry of Culture. This matter is now with the Ministry of Culture. They are looking into the matter. There are demands made by one other section of the society with respect to their language. Now, these demands are being looked into by the Expert Committee, and after the Expert Committee comes to any conclusion, the Ministry of Culture will take a decision in the matter.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: Sir, in reply to Unstarred Question No. 1381, it was stated, """"The Ministry of Culture had received presentation from various quarters for declaring Kannada as classical language. A Committee of Linguistic Experts has been constituted to examine the claims of any language classical language status. This Committee will advise the Government in the matter."""" This answer was given on 6.3.2006. Subsequently, to me also, the Minister of Culture has replied saying that it has been referred. Now, the question before the House is as to how long it will go on like this. There is a limit to the patience of the people also. They are losing their patience. You may not believe, but they are condemning and criticising the Parliamentarians and saying that Karnataka M.P.'s are dormant; they are inactive.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Please, ask the question. Don't make a statement.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: How long will the Government take a decision? After being referred to the Expert Committee, there has been a lapse of one year, what action is going to be taken by the Government?

MR. CHAIRMAN: Mr. Poojary, this is a supplementary question. Please, ask the question. Don't make a statement.

SHRI SHIVRAJ V. PATIL: As a matter of fact, this question should have been sent to the Ministry of Culture. But, because, the notice was given to us, and the notice was given at the last moment, the question was accepted and we are replying to it. As a matter of fact, it is only the Ministry of Culture which is in a position to take a decision with respect to this, and I would like to say that the language should unit; language should not divide. Many languages in our country are rich languages and they should be a source of our unity rather than division. So, it would be necessary for all of us to tell our brothers and sisters in the States that on the basis of language, division should not be created. Because the languages are rich; because the languages are ancient; because...(Interruptions).

Image copyright problem RE: Image:Wilno.PNG

 This image may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Wilno.PNG. The Wikimedia Foundation is very careful about the images included in Wikipedia because of copyright law. We need you to specify two things on the image description page:
 The copyright holder, and
 The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder. If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikipedia, we've sorted them using image copyright tags. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: {{TAGHERE}}.  

There are 3 basic ways to licence an image on Wikipedia:
An open content licence
Public Domain
Fair Use

The copyright holder gets the best protection of their work by licencing it under an open content license such as the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence. If you have the express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence, use the image copyright tag: . The GNU Free Documentation License is another option. Again, if you have the express permission of the copyright holder, use the tag .

The copyright holder can also release their work into the public domain. See here for examples.

Images from certain sources are automatically released into the public domain. This is true for the United States, where the Wikimedia servers are located. (See here  for images from the government of the USA and here for other governments.)  However, not all governments release their work into the public domain. One exception is the UK (see here for images from the UK government). Non-free licence governments are listed here. 

Also, in some cases, an image is copyrighted but allowed on Wikipedia because of fair use. To see a) if this image qualifies, and b) if so, how to tag it, see Wikipedia:Fair use.  

For more information, see Wikipedia:Image copyright tags. Please remember that untagged images are likely to be deleted.

If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them. Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.

If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The main idea for chapter two, Nonverbal communication: its origins and development, is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction, facial expressions, and modifying emotional expressiveness. """"With age, children's encoding (sending messages) and decoding (interpreting messages) skills increase. Yet children are better at decoding than at encoding, a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 35). This fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. 
The main point for chapter three, The development of language, is the social development based on the environment of the child. """"Children's nonverbal communication skills, especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers, foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication."""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 57) Good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication, mainly nonverbal, and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. This chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. The stages include prelinguistic development, speech perception/production, semantic development, private speech, and first words. 
Also, the main idea for chapter four, Developing verbal communication and how its relevant in children's acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. A main focus is """"discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development"""" for infants """"emerging abilities to control their communicative skills"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 105). All three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children.

In 1945 there was some initial speculation among the scientists developing the first nuclear weapons that there might be a possibility of igniting the earth's atmosphere with a large enough nuclear explosion.

We can have material split across three articles, if that is the best way to do it.  Or we can have two articles, with a redirect from new antisemtitism to contemporary antisemitism, or vice versa.  The advantage of multiple articles is that it gives a sharper focus on a specific issue.  The disadvantage is duplication.  

The problem I have with the current article is that it isn't clear to me what the distinction between new antisemitism and 'old' antisemitism is, or even if there is one.  Some duplication is OK but when I have no way to decide what should go into new antisemitism and what should go into antisemitism, I think there's a problem.  The advantage of contemporary antisemitism over new antisemitism is that it has quite a clear definition.  The advantage of new antisemitism over contemporary antisemitism could be that new antisemitism is not just antisemitism in the here and now but somehow something different.  That we have a history of new antisemitism suggests that a difference exists, but I don't see what that difference is.

The current introduction says that new antisemitism is """"the wave of antisemitism that escalated, particularly in Western Europe, after the Second Intifada in 2000, the failure of the Oslo accords, and the September 11, 2001 attacks."""" But it then says what is different about new antisemitism is that old antisemitism """"was largely associated with the political right.""""  So I'm confused.  Is it the distinguishing factor the timing, or is it more to do with the source, in which case perhaps we should be talking not about new antisemitism but about new antisemites; a new chorus singing an old song?  In the introduction we mention anti-zionism in passing, but we don't make clear what the relationship between it and new antisemitism is, we just say that there is one.

The history section talks about a Soviet new anti-Semitism, and says this antisemtism was """"close to its modern form"""".  But it doesn't explain what close means.  Presumably there are important ways in which it is similar and ways in which it is different, but the article doesn't explain what they are.

Further down, we seem to be equating new antisemitism with anti-zionism.  Maybe this is the crux of my issues with this article.  We have anti-zionism; hatred of/opposition to an jewish state.  We have anti-semitism; hatred of/opposition to the jewish race (common usage. technically arabs are also semites, but lets not go there now).   We can also identify anti-Israel sentiment; opposition to some or all aspects of Israel.  These things all overlap, but it's hard to say that any of them are the same, or a subset of each other.  For example there were jews opposed to the creation of Israel because it was man-made, not created by god.  And some dislike of Israel is anti-semitic, but not all of it.  The boundaries are fuzzy, but for each of these concepts there is a clear and unmistakable core.  I can't say that for new-antisemtism.  I can't identify what new-antisemitism is that old-antisemtism is not.

To me, new antisemitism seems to be a grab bag of an expression that mixes some different issues:  1. the apparent resurgence in antisemitism, which I suggest properly belongs at contemporary antisemitism; 2. the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate/illegitimate criticism of israel, which I suggest belongs here, or possibly at anti-zionism; and 3. the changing nature of the anti-semite (left/right/arab/european/russian/...) which I suggest belongs at contemporary antisemitism and/or at antisemitism.

Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone, in the absence of a Pope was thus and in fact fulfilling in the Office of  “Pope in Charge”, and now to some extent he Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone along with another office in the Vatican hold more power than the actual Pope, thus his Office is of a more intricate and hands on job of power, than that of a Pope.

 Excellent work! 
I have been away from Wikipedia for years, and largely due to users like the despicable, self-deluded Gavin Collins. To return here after so much time and find that he has been removed from the site is an utter joy, on several levels. Justice has finally been served, proving that the system here actually works, albeit slowly. However, I can't help but feel sick about the time, energy, and effort the Wikipedia community has expended (i.e., wasted) in dealing with this Gavin Collins, a terrifically disruptive and possibly mentally disturbed individual. It is incredible to me that one user has caused such extensive damage and unending headache, heartache, and loss of resources. Yes, instead of spending hundreds of hours dealing with Gavin Collins' nonsensical, myopic, obtuse, elliptical, deconstructive, and dense argumentation, we could all have been making this a better place. And now, he's gone. So in a sense, I suppose those hours lost were not for nothing. And at the end of the day, Gavin Collins' dubious legacy is deeply stamped.

Now that is a heavily biased remark if I ever saw one. Talk about racism.

Took me a while to figure out what you were talking about; that edit was almost a month ago.  The explanation on the page suggested that making the edit would block the script running the bot from its source, which was the intention.  Blocking the IP it was using as a logged-out bot, which is what was originally done, was causing collateral damage.  All bots are supposed to know that they're logged out and stop themselves (or be able to log themselves back in); the absence of that section of code is a serious matter, because bot editing is restricted to named bot accounts, and is essentially a malfunction.  Just think if someone had blocked the range (which someone was considering doing!), not realizing that it was the WMF Labs - none of the Labs-based tools regularly used on this project would have functioned, and cross-wiki bot activity would also have been adversely affected.  Better than 90% of bots include code that tells the bot how to check if it is logged in, and what to do if it is not, and many that don't require hands-on control. There's no reason for these ones not to include that code. Heck, they can probably swipe it from one of the other open-source coded bots currently in operation.  
I'm also confused by your statement,  was the bot blocked or not? and was it editing logged-in or logged-out? If it was editing logged out, then there's an even more serious problem because it should always need a manual restart after a block.  If it was editing logged-in, then the """"kill switch"""" isn't working.  So, no matter how you look at it, something's not working right.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

In researching the maps for the initially planed expansion of the airport, I couldn't find any evidence of plans for a cloverleaf shaped configuration with four terminal rings as was added to the article without naming a sourced by an IP last October. It is also very obvious from the maps, that such a configuration could only be built after major reconstruction in the area immediately south of the existing buildings, including the demolition of the power station and the taxiway overpass as well as parts of the air cargo building. It seems extremely unlikely that the plans ever called for such a comprehensive destruction of buildings from earlier expansion phases of the same plans. The historic urban planing maps also show no sign of an expansion of the airport beyond the current boundaries of its grounds.

Other user's also noted that Renee's approach is threating . My stand is not restricted to any particular group or person, but my concern is more about the direction wikipedia is moving into, as noted before, the talk page of the concern topic is now deleted, my objection remains same, there was a link on that page, which pointed towards previously deleted article and i noticed comments from 4 member's only, one was user:Jossi who has admitted that he is on pay role of prem rawat second was from User:Bksimonb who works in PR team of brahma Kumari, both of these user's have admitted their direct involvement with the respective groups, third person was User:Reneeholle, fourth user was Don. Renee has not admitted her paid involvement with this particular group, but her edit behavior clearly showed the same, Moreover there is NOT A SINGLE NOTE FROM ME ON HER TALK PAGE as i simply ignored her threating messages, which were moving more towards legal threat, as noted by more then one wikipedia editor.

I suspect her paid involvement with the group, while we were working on a temp page, about the subject, (on advice of another admin User:Will_Beback), and there one statement was made that there is dispute between two groups, and reference given was court docket, (which was taken as it is, from wikipedia's french twin of the subject). She removed the dispute section from temp page and stated that judgment is in favor of one party, and reference given was some blog !! Giving reference  of a blog, after removing a court docket from a temp page, indicates some problem, or something fishy. This heavy biasing and attempt to reduce information from wikipedia is harmful for future prospectives of wikipedia project, As the talk page which i am referring to has already been deleted, so there is no trace of that particular discussion left, if this tendency of curbing information from paid member's of corresponding groups is not checked, it may lead wikipedia into a wrong direction, or may be in that direction which is not intended.

My direct involvement with article's is bare minimum, mostly i am on talk pages, discussing the matter and letting informed people make the edits once it is agreed. Regarding calling a group a cult, is something which is based in WP:RS if there is a reliable source which refers a group as cult, I write honestly that the group is cult, as per this particular WP:RS and hence respective member's are referred to as cult member's.

I did not filed any personal attack request at notice board, for all the abuses made against me, for the simple reason that i believe that editor's are free to make comments whatever they feel is appropriate, even for abuses that were placed at either my user page or talk page, i have never taken the matter beyond placing the link for the same. 

But I am surprise to see that a comment in response to statement made on my talk page, by another user, about first user, can tantamount to personal attack, given the fact, when it is made for a genuine concern that the said thread appears to be legal in nature. My statement was either she is a paid member or mentally sick as i could not find any other reason for such threats when t",0,0,0,0,0,0

 JFK """"invited"""" Glenn to explain delays? 

This dubious footnote was just added:
""""...a frustrated politician compared the spacecraft-Atlas combination to """"a Rube Goldberg device on top of a plumber's nightmare"""" and John Glenn was invited to the White House to explain the delays.""""

This New Ocean verifies the senator's remark, but makes it clear that JFK, while disappointed like everyone else, believed NASA knew best what was required to make the flight with reasonable safety, and describes Glenn's February visit (incidental to his visiting family in Virginia) as """"a brief visit with President Kennedy, who asked him many semitechnical questions about plans and systems for the orbital flight"""" (citing several newspaper reports), but says nothing at all about Kennedy demanding Glenn """"explain delays"""". This would seem totally out of character for JFK; I removed it. I have no idea who this Brit John Catchpole is, but I would suggest being cautious about regarding his Project Mercury - NASA's First Manned Space Programme as a reliable source about certain things.

 regarding a wiki writer 

Regarding the writer at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html and referenced at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute please note the following:  Mr. Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page- as Dr. Curry attempted to correct the many errors). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people, and those people also often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the “Nazi-Soviet pact” page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made by Professor Curry. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also uses the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether salutes dictate particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany. 

    Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain inaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to blabber with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.   The John Seigenthaler story from Brian Chase is another notorious example of Wikipedia’s untrustworthiness.  On Wikipedia, the intellectually dishonest administrators block people who tell the truth, so it is specious to say that truth-tellers simply need to correct the articles.  

    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who """"became wiser"""", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledg",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for the support... by the time you added that comment I'd changed the tautology para, and removed all the others so I'm not clear which """"current"""" para you mean. Quite a lot of consilidation done tonight; I'm much happier with the current text than before. From my POV the main remaining problem is the lead paragraph which I hope the current text demonstates is seriously misleading. Here is my proposed new version:

In physics and cosmology, the anthropic principle was originally the rule of reasoning that we should take account of the constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of universe that we could observe. The term has since been extended to cover supposed """"superlaws"""" that in various ways require the universe to support intelligent life, usually assumed to be carbon-based, and occasionally to be specifically human beings. Anthropic reasoning involves assessing these constraints by analysing the properties of universes with different fundamental parameters or laws of physics from ours, and has frequently concluded that essential structures, from atomic nuclei to the whole universe, depend for stability on delicate balances between different fundamental forces; balances which only occur in a small minority of possible universes — so that ours seems to be  fine-tuned for life. Anthropic reasoning also attempts to explain and quantify this fine tuning. Within the scientific community the usual approach is to invoke selection effects from a real ensemble of alternate universes; competing strategies, occasionally also called anthropic, include intelligent Design. 
 
This would allow some shortening of the second para discussing controversies. You can see that I plan to have Anthropic reasoning re-direct to this page.  You can also see that I think we should avoid getting hung up on the tautologous nature of some statements of the AP (including the one you like), because I do think that misses the point.(c.f. new first para to the Character of Anthropic reasoning section). Oh, another proposal: merge the Bostrom section into the Variants, i.e. add his self sampling assumption as an AP-type statement. What do you think?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Comment on Seregain 

Actually, I was never almost blocked for my behavior. If you'll read the past AN/I incident, a user (Coldplay Expert) proposed a malformed """"topic ban"""" after the issue had already been resolved (which Jclemens corrected him on). He apologized afterwards

In the past AFD, I addressed each of Seregain's allegations individually and proved that most of them were lies or misunderstandings, and also provided a series of links which show that he is a likely banned editor come back under a new screenname for the purpose of pushing an evangelical Christian POV (he has only 200 edits, his 1st of which was a well-formed AFD for Secular Student Alliance, and this is just the tip of the iceberg).

Since Jclemens ended the dispute, Seregain's edits were never reviewed, but I'll be happy to bring them back up again. As for """"wikistalking"""", Seregain linked to an offsite forum profile which he believed to be me and complained on Wikipedia for something said offline (personally I think he deserves an immediate ban for trying to """"out"""" me on other sites, but I'll let the admins handle it).

I've great respect for GwenGale. I don't, however, have any respect whatsoever for the preposterous, not to say idiotic, rules and policies of WP. That and that alone makes me unsuitable for editing any WP article whatsoever. I also think that it is those very rules and policies that gut any integrity a so called minority view article could ever have. The only thing the WP rules and policies have accomplished at the AS article is to prevent useful, important and thoroughly verified information to be included, at the same time irrelevant and factually false claims have been inflated and scattered all through the article. There is no integrity there, very little informative value and a high degree of distortion. If that is the WP idea of """"integrity"""", then that is an integrity not worth protecting. And isn't WP supposed to the free and public encyclopedia? If that is the case, why should we be bound by any dictates from Jimmy Wales? We are the editors, not him. He may have founded it, but we are the ones upholding it. By the logic employed by some editors here, the government should be allowed to have total control of the internet, because it was government that """"created"""" the internet. That is the principle WP seems to follow, and I reject that principle. I also submit that any rule and policy that is so demonstrably destructive as those employed in editing the AS article can and should be altered or abolished.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Baroque Guitars are NOT """"ten-string guitars""""
Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a """"ten-string guitar"""". No one refers to the baroque lute as """"the 24-string lute"""", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. """"12-string guitar"""" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular """"cult(ure)"""" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term """"ten-string"""" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

d67bee158e51d8b0,"removing edits concerning air crash investigations and qualifying them as third class spam 

Someone (AndyTheGrump) is accusing me of putting information about aircraft investigations as third class spam mail on wikipedia. This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am an aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol-Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University Rotterdam, 1973))and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I am a registered transport consultant at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not all use metric systems.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, or simply (against all international rules) not available. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Everybody likes to avoid the mistakes others made. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish for many years these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Aviation security and safety is not a joke. Because we are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large, the books become too expensive (especially for third world countries) and after a certain time the publication is no more available. You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us. You think we make any money out of this? Think about translation costs, not everybody works for free. This way you do not help wikipedia, but you are a stumble block. You are probably some kind of Johnny the Selfkicker.

 Any chance of a return to Good Article status? 

Talk:Harley-Davidson/GA1

When this review was done, the reasons for stripping this article of its """"Good Article"""" status were as follows:
Prose quality: Too many orphan sentences and single sentence paragraphs.
MoS compliance: Introduction is too short, see WP:LEAD for more info. Introduction should be a summary of the entire article, and generally should not contain information which is not contained within the body. One of the images contains a watermark for a website. 
Citation of reliable sources where necessary: Large areas of uncited information. Orphan sentences only complicate the issue of finding what comes from which source. Article is littered with tags and rough edits.
 No original research: Uncited information may contain original research.

Since that time, the introduction has been expanded, the offending watermark has been cropped out of the image (which had been donated under the appropriate licence by the site in question), and citations have been added, though maybe not enough.

The peer reviewer tool came up with the following concerns:
Consider adding more links to the article; per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links) and Wikipedia:Build the web, create links to relevant articles.
Per Wikipedia:What is a featured article?, Images should have concise captions.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (numbers), there should be a non-breaking space -   between a number and the unit of measurement. For example, instead of 45 cubic inch, use 45 cubic inch, which when you are editing the page, should look like: 45 cubic inch.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally do not start with articles ('the', 'a(n)'). For example, if there was a section called ==The Biography==, it should be changed to ==Biography==.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally should not repeat the title of the article. For example, if the article was Ferdinand Magellan, instead of using the heading ==Magellan's journey==, use ==Journey==.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), avoid using special characters (ex: &+{}[]) in headings.
Per WP:WIAFA, this article's table of contents (ToC) may be too long – consider shrinking it down by merging short sections or using a proper system of daughter pages as per Wikipedia:Summary style.
#The script has spotted the following contractions: Didn't, if these are outside of quotations, they should be expanded. (A search of the article found the use of """"didn't"""" in a quote of a reference.)

We should also keep an eye on WP:SIZERULE, which indicates that we should probably split this article.  Granted, the 91 kB size is a gross figure and the readable prose would be somewhat less, but splitting off and summarizing the History and Engines sections might be advisable.  

The Model Designations section could also use some work.

O.K., folks, are we up to it?

 2012 THE END OF HUMAN HISTORY 

On this day 12/21/2012 will be a momentus day in the history of our planet and our civilization.  We will finally learn that humans are not alone in this universe and it will be discovered in a tremendous fasion.  We will learn that this universe is much more than anyone ever imagined, we will shed the """"god"""" myths of this world and know for the first time that humans are one of many species in this universe, not just our galaxy but the whole of the universe.  

The hate and war and injustices created by """"mans"""" religion will be over, the discovery will transport humans to another level never before imagined, technology will advance far beyond what we believed capable.  This will be a time of fear for many, losing ones """"god"""" and finding out that it was all man made will create those that refuse to move forward and experience the true meaning of our existance.  Many will try to impede our elevation to join the community of the universe and will try to attempt to demonize the truth and stop all of us from the truth.  

Many of humanity will choose to leave this world behind and travel to the stars in search of science, truth, logic and reason leaving those to their fate on planet Earth.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

To say that """"Britain headed the Commonwealth"""" is simply wrong and it represents a misunderstand of what the Commonwealth was and is. onec again: Britain and the Dominions (or later Commonwealth realms) were considered to be equals in the Commonwealth (whereas British India, in 1939, and the crown colonies were not). Hence the Dominions declared war independently of Britain in 1939 (and the Irish Free State, which was a Dominion at the time, remained neutral). Britain is not even a """"first among equals"""". That is the difference between the Commonwealth of Nations and the British Empire. In fact, for most of the war, the vast majority of Australian forces served under Douglas MacArthur in the South West Pacific Area, rather than under British commanders anywhere else. 

Similarly it is a misrepresentation to say that the United States """"ran"""" the Kuomintang. In fact, the Americans — whose forces were technically under Chiang Kai Shek when they served in China — found it very hard to get Chiang to fight the Japanese as much as they would have liked, since he was more concerned with stockpiling weapons and materiel to fight the communists.

In short, I think the division into the Big 3 and subordinate allies is historically incorrect.

The reality was that the communist Khmer Rouge leadership ran the whole operation, as they showed at once when they came to power.

 The poison 

When the japanese diplomat replaced huo's tea with the poisoned one, did Anno Tanaka realise at the end of the movie? To me, it is strongly implied as a yes. There is evidence that supports it, and is strongly shown when the japanese diplomat said """"Who say?, Who saw it?"""" after Tanaka gave the victory to Huo when they were walking out of the arena. Anno Tanaka replied """"I saw myself"""" and then went on telling him that he was a disgrace to the japanese people. Also right after Huo collapsed from his final blow, he said """"wait"""" and held him, observing his face and it looks like he realised or must have seen. This also shows that he must have realised that he was poisoned. 

I am pretty sure that Anno Tanaka did know at the end.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

After your first message I put this on the talk page, but you maybe didn't have time to read it before the article was deleted:
If you want detail about why it is historically nonsense: York and Lancaster were branches of the house of Plantagenet, competing with each other but not with some independent """"Plantagenet"""" faction. The house of Tudor was descended (maternally) from a branch of the Lancasters, who did not survive the wars. The first Tudor King, Henry VII, came to the throne by winning the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, which was Tudor vs. York. The next year he married Elizabeth of York which helped legitimise his claim to the throne; but any tensions in the next few years were Tudor vs. York, not Tudor and York vs. """"Plantagenet assemblies.""""
Research: I read the articles Plantagenet, Tudor dynasty, Battle of Bosworth, Henry VII of England, Elizabeth of York, checked the links  and a few on-line sources about Norton Canes, and off-line checked A.R.Myers, England in the Late Middle Ages, p.185, which lists risings and disturbances from 1486 to 1497 but does not mention this, and C.

Few had undergone sexual reassignment surgery; among them, 73% identified as female and 24% as postoperative transsexual. A majority identified as heterosexual.""""
This points out an interesting thing.  The large majority of the transgender individuals in the survey were pre-operative.  Since the only receptive intercourse available to them is oral, or anal, they are more likely to engage in URAS.  Honestly, I like the idea of """"URAS"""", it should be: """"People engaging in URAS"""" as the risk category... and we could avoid this whole """"who's male who's female"""" idiocy.

The section on the English Computer Misuse Act is completely, utterly wrong.

Thus, it criminalizes attacks on other people's computers. It has nothing to do with protecting copyright-holders from unauthorized access performed by a user on his own computer.

Adjusting for the known effects that finasteride has on prostate cancer detection, investigators estimated that high-grade tumors (Gleason scores 7–10) were no more likely in the men taking finasteride than in the men taking placebo. However, because very few prostate cancers were detected at Gleason scores of 8 to 10, it is difficult to draw conclusions about this group.""""
From this text, I think it would be appropriate to say something like - In contrast to the FDA's stance, the National Cancer Institute believes that finasteride may increase the ability to detect cancer which accounts for the higher prevalance of high-grade cancer.  The article didn't specifically mention the NIH, but if you can cite it feel free to add it in the article and somebody will change it if they object.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Following the move, the college began to offer a number of Theology and Education
 degrees which were validated by the Council for National Academic Awards (the CNAA).
 When this was scrapped following the 1992 Education Act, the college entered an 
 academic partnership with the University of Oxford allowing Westminster students to 
 read for degrees of the University. 

NOTE: This is not correct. Degrees were those of the University of Oxford until, in what many people felt was a singularly ill-judged action, Westminster parted from the University of Oxford. After that, the degrees were validated by the CNAA until the union with Oxford Brookes.

 Henry Dunant

The """"Samaritan of Europe"""" began with the aim of being """"more effective in Christian charity,"""" """"to heat up the lukewarm"""" believers, and to """"convert those who had not met God"""" (as stated in the Société; by Henry Dunant).

In A memory of Solferino he calls """"gracious"""" the self-sacrificing Christian devotion. 
The two sources that claim that he became an agnostic """"in his last years"""" do not point to any original source, nor have any documented quotation of him on the subject. Neither Oscar Riddle nor the NNDB give any reference to an original source to support their claims, which make their assertion unreliable.

 COI 
This is my statement
When I first took an interest in Wikipedia I scratched my head for subjects to take on. During the process of Googling old friends and acquaintance - as everyone does - I discovered that an old friend Greg Day was now running a PR company and I looked up one or two of his clients. Seeing that one or two - Kevin Howarth, Simon Rumley, were not mentioned on Wikipedia I thought that I would have a go at tackling them. I could have contributed to many other pages - and have - but I wanted to be the initiator of a page that no one had tackled before. Not long afterwards Greg Day got in touch and mentioned that he had seen the pages. He said """"how would I like to be an associate of the company""""  and - being a journalist and always looking for extra bits on the CV - I said why not. I then went on and edited Alan Jones and Hayley-Marie Axe, never thinking that any conflict of interest was involved. I still do not think that any COI was involved since a) I was never paid to do it b) I was never requested to do it c) I was trying to make a statement and not advocating or promoting anyone's career d) Writing and researching Wikipedia is just a hobby, end of. If that is so then you may as well say there is a COI over my edits of the Bolingbrokes and the Somervilles to whom my connections are no less nor more than the Howarths and the Rumleys - random topics of interest. That does not constitute a COI.

COI
whatever you think best. I wouldn't mind, but this """"policy"""" seems to be applied in a random fashion and would only be fair if it was applied universally. Are you seriously expecting me to believe that the editors who originate pages about commercial product don't have some vested interests and/or COI. One would have to suspend disbelief to take that line. I have read not one but dozens of articles that do a wonderful job of promoting commercial interests. I guess it's one law for the independent editors and another for the corporations. Thus was it always. Rather than picking on people like me and making mountains out of molehills it would serve Wikipedia better to weed out the real abuses by cynical commercial interests rather than the perceived ones. 
Anyway, I do not own the pages discussed, so people can do whatever they like. I'm sure Jimmy wales never intended Wikipedia to become such a bear pit!

I am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves McGeddon. I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLL's motives are. I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa. If that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo, they are both me, I couldn't remember my password for Zambo, which is my maiden name, so i made Moyo, which is my married name. This strange person McGeddon, who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. I see he does this to everyone, it's probably because he has no power in the real world. Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL. I admit i am not an expert at editing wiki pages but instead of assistance from this McGeddon he choose the vindictive route flexing his technical knowledge.

There's been an amusing tit-for-tat re-edit of the location of Whitgift School as a result of user Samtheboy mistakenly believing that the school is in the county of Surrey. Without wishing to sound like an anorak, this Greater London vs. the 'old' county boundaries around London is a bit of an old chestnut. Significant changes in local government in the 1960s and 70s (the result of the inexorable spread of suburban London) meant that towns like Croydon, Kingston and Bromley in the south were swallowed up by London, becoming the London Borough of Croydon, etc. One old county - Middlesex - disappeared altogether. Confusingly, the Post Office retained the old names, disregarding the new borough locations, and to this day people in places like Thornton Heath believe they live in Surrey - a fact which couldn't be further from the truth. The same is true of south Croydon, which is in the London Borough of Croydon and hence Greater London. The county of Surrey begins further down the road and the local council taxpayers, commercial ratepayers and other residents of south Croydon pay their taxes, have their roads repaired and their refuse collected by the local London borough. I suppose the reaction is: who cares? But if Wikipedia has pretentions to accuracy, we should get these things right. Nowhere will Samtheboy or anyone else find any accurate evidence that Whitgift school is in Surrey because the simple fact is that it is not. End of sermon.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I would disagree with whole """"how it is seen by the world"""" statement.  First of all, it will be seen by the world as it presents itself.  I really doubt after they stop using SUNY at Stony Brook, which they just have, that this name will last in anyones memory for long.  I would also point you to some less political references than those you put up, such as the wikipedia article for University at Buffalo, State University of New York.  They did the same thing a while back, and their website uses that designation.  Berkely is the same way.  It is technically UC Berkeley, but that isn't what you see on their website.

It would not be surprising that anything from SUNY head office or whatever it is would continue to use the old designation, but that is politics, and is hardly an area we need to play to here.  If they could stop Stony Brook from changing their name, they would.  No bureaucrat gives up power if they can prevent it.  It is a fait accompli.

However, from these data one can assess what importance should be attached to the Rodgers study. After reading the Rodgers paper and assembling the data he used, it became clear that quoting one sentence from Rodgers' conclusion overstated what could validly be drawn from the Rodgers analysis of the data shown above. The following text would be an acceptable compromise:
 """"Rodgers analysed annual (1973 to 1987) national time-series estimates of cycling injuries, annual counts of cycling and pedestrian road accident fatalities, estimates of bicycle use and bicycle standards compliance, and estimates of helmet use based on sales of one particular brand of (now obsolete) hard-shell helmet. After fitting a linear regression model to these data he concluded that: """"There is no evidence that hard shell helmets have reduced the head injury and fatality rates.

 Bias? 

It seems a little weighted towards Al-Megrahi being wrongly convicted, just does not read neutral to me. I've subsequently tagged the article, to see if anyone could take a look and see if they can do anything about it. Cheers.   

Well, according to the article:

...the SCCRC concluded its four-year review and, having uncovered evidence that a miscarriage of justice could have occurred...

So, giving some considerable weight to doubts about his guilt would be justified.   

That is true, but it stands that he is a convicted mass murderer who took the lives of hundreds of people. To have the majority of the article weighted towards his alleged innocence/appeals etc seems disproportionately biased in his favour. While I know that there is obviously a distinct article on the bombing, it doesn't quite seem appropriate that the article about the guilty party is leaning heavily towards innocence. In light of the dropping of the appeal, it seems somewhat unlikely that he will be exhonerated, so it's not even as if Megrahi's status, in a legal sense, will alter (in terms of innocent vs guilty, rather than incarcerated vs free). I'm not sure what to do to alter the article, which is why I tagged it, to see if anyone else had any ideas. I accept entirely what you're saying, and I even agree, I just, like I said, find that focus disproportionate.   

This legal speak is very cautious. """"A miscarriage of justice could have occurred"""" means in reality that it is practically certain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. So, he is convicted, yes, but a mass murderer, no, the guilty party, no, most likely not. Concerning the future, nobody knows, but there remains a strong pressure to reopen the case.213.84.53.62  

My understanding of the legal status is that """"A miscarriage of justice could have occurred"""" does not, by any stretch, mean that the occurrence of such a miscarriage is """"practically certain.""""  If you have evidence to that effect, I would be happy to see it.  It only means that there is sufficient reason to justify the time and expense of further investigation.  We should also be wary of political pressures on the relevant actors in this case, coming from both directions, and to me this diminishes the weight of several quotations in favor of al-Megrahi; there was significant pressure on law enforcement agencies to put someone away for the Lockerbie bombing, and just as surely there was just as much pressure on Libya and its friends to exonerate him, due to the sanctions and damage to international reputation and etc.  This is why I think less weight should be given to quotations and more weight to the hard evidence. 

Perhaps the article would read a little less biased if it actually included some of the relevant points from the original case against him? It doesn't really tell a reader why he was convicted in the first place.-12.70.92.162  

I absolutely agree.  First, the weight of the evidence in favor of a conviction should be given.  The page says nothing about what he is accused of doing and why the judges reached the conclusion they did.  Second, even though reasons have been given to doubt the conviction, responses to those reasons should also be given.  Presumably those who remain convinced of al-Megrahi's guilt, especially those who were involved in the initial trial, have offered responses to the allegations of a miscarriage of justice.  Al-Megrahi was convicted; this much is fact.  Voices should be heard that believe the conviction was wrong, and voices should be heard that believe it was right.  It is partly the absence of this secondary response that gives the article a prejudiced feel to me.  

Having read the entire article, I must agree with Sky83 and 12.70.92.162. How many times is the phrase """"miscarriage of justice"""" used here? There is actually very little information provided to show a miscarriage of justice took place (One of Hans Koechler's reason for doubting the validity of the conviction: """"A retired Scottish police officer has signed a statement confirming that the evidence that found Al-Megrahi guilty was fabricated. The police chief, whose identity has not yet been revealed, testified “that the CIA planted the tiny fragment of circuit board crucial in convicting a Libyan” for the bombing of the Pan Am jet (Scotland on Sunday, 28 August 2005).""""

all nestorians in Mesopotamia were Assyrian, that is how it is proven that Chaldean converts were originally ACOE members. that is the biggest lie i have ever heard. And the reason why you think Chaldeans are Assyrians is because of this false statement. I hope you know this that until the 12th century AD the majority of Iraq were Christians, I doubt that only existed of Assyrians do you know why?? Not all Assyrians lived in today's Iraq, they were spread all around the middle east after the fall of their empire. Many Assyrians fled to the Hakkari mountains (in today's turkey, and others also fled to other countries like Syria. I find it very hard to believe that even when not half of the Assyrian population lived in Iraq they still could make up the majority of the citizens of Iraq, are you being bribed or something cause you know yourself that a people cant just dissapear, and the Babylonians, never had the time to flee from their empire cause they never had the idea the Medes would backstabb them and allie themeselve with the Persians. Your username is named after your faith, well if you believe so much in your faith open the Bible to Daniel 5: 5-30 and it will prove to you that there was no major batlle between Persia and the Medes against the Babylonians cause they were caught by suprise. You probably thinking what does this have to do with nestorians, well it only proves that no massacres took place when Babylonia was conquered, and that the Babylonians still lived in their ancestors land. Babylon had its province under the Persian empire, Ssanien empire and the Seleucid empire, these were the only empires that took control over the land of the Babylonians until the Muslim invasion, which then the Nestorian Church was established and the Chaldeans were a part of it.

Answer me these question, under what empire was the Nestorian Church established?? I really hope its not to hard for you to answer with your bias.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Justanother 
Hey! I'm glad you wrote me. This guy is exactly the kind of person I do not like. I don't know where to begin describing everything that is wrong with him. I can see it in the replies to you as well. L.Ron's military career, if it is fabricated, is obviously worth discussing. I don't know why it would be fabricated, it wouldn't change my opinion of him or anythiing, so many times things aren't what they seem, but it's still worth looking into. It isn't 'he said, she said', it can be figured out what the truth is. And he says anything else is PR. This is what bugs me about justanother, he says things like they are fact. NO, it isn't just PR. It could be that he lied, it could be that there was a mistake, etc. That isn't PR.

Ok, now I'm reading the posts on yourpage. This is so hard to understand. You're not supposed to talk about Scientology with him, he says? """"Is that clear""""? See,he speaks to people with an air of superiority, like he is the voice of reason, of authority.""""And I have no doubt that you consider yourself the soul of equanimity and justice."""" COMPLETE PROJECTION. 

Whoa, I'm on the Barbara Schwarz page, he did this with me to. I don't understand those people who feel the need to inform you of obvious thigns you would never do like you need them to inform you otherwise you would do it. He did that to me at first when we were friendly regarding editing Scientology pages (telling me not to do this or that, which I would never have done). 

I think the good thing is that this is just the internet. If it were real life, we would be able to tell in a second what was up with this guy and we wouldn't apply him the same weight that we apply other people. I sometimes forget that when I use the net because you're not getting the feel of the person saying the weird thing. It used to bug me some of the things that critics of Scientology used to say, and then I saw photos and video of them, and it made sense. You could tell they weren't really there, so I wasn't upset anymore. I'd love to see what this guy looks like. I'd probably end up feeling sorry for him and have compassion and overlook all the incredibly rude traits he has. 

I don't know how to explain how things got bad between us. It's just his personality, who he is, and I disagree iwth it, find it incredibly rude and invalidating to other people, and just let him know. 

 You're on the Scientology's 'enemies' list? What happened? You defintely didn't imply anythiing negative about Scientology, it's all good. People I know make jokes about Scientology and it's totally fine. I know what I don't like and don't agree it and I'm not sensing any of that from you. Another thing about Anynobdoy, is he DOES seem like everything is pro-Scientology, no matter what, and I've noticed that with some Scientologists, but that's not me, and that's wrong. I dislike a lot of Scientologists I've met because I can tell the kind of people they are and the kinds of things that they would do or think, and I'm just not okay with that. Scientology isn't some group that you join and become this ideal Scientologist and just turn into that. It's like when I go to the gym. I don't adapt the feeling and personality of the gym and the people in the gym. I go there to work my body, to use it as a tool. I do the same thing with Scientology. I really hate when people do that because what starts happening is they start feeling like they're better than others because they """"act"""" more like an ideal Scientologist than people who aren't doing that, and all sorts of other things, which I think our friend here might've done.  )

 Query 

I suppose I should have taken the point better when you made it here. This is neither a challenge, a complaint, nor a whine, or an attempt to """"gotcha"""" but a ood–faith question and a related comment on which I'd like your observations.
Question: John Bapst Memorial High School 2005 was nominated — not by me — and subsequently deleted yesterday under A7. (I think that's the one, not being a sysop — ahem () — I can't go back to look to make sure.) The entire text of the article was something like, """"Composed of people born in 1986 and 1987. Said to be the best class to ever graduate from this school."""" As I understand from the discussions at Talk:CSD, an indication of importance or significance is credible if it is plausible, even if it is vague and unsupported. That school's class of 2005 could, in fact, have been the best to graduate from that school in many different ways: highest GPA, most athletic championships, fewest teenage pregnancies, or in a 5–year retrospect, most graduates to be admitted to Ivy League schools. None of that is, of course, probably what the creator meant, which was probably nothing more than chauvinistic chest–thumping (but we must AGF). Was that an indication of importance or significance such that the article should not have been A7 nominated or deleted on that basis?
Comment: If I were to start declining A7 speedy noms by strictly applying the criteria you set out at my RfA nomination, viz """"A7 simply does not apply if there is any credible indication of importance or significance"""", then I have the suspicion that at my next RfA nomination, if I choose to try again (and your responses here may help me decide whether or not I will do so), that I may have a hoard of opposers claiming that I'm perverting the CSD process by glibly dismissing valid CSD nominations. I'm concerned that by working on CSD nominations at all that I'm stuck between the battle lines drawn by the deletionists and the inclusionists. If I have any remaining desire for the mop, wouldn't it be better to just avoid CSD altogether?

Look, in life, some things are subject to individivual opinion. Political persepctives for example - we can't predict how human beings will behave, so nobody really knows whether left wing or right wing approaches are the best way to run societies. But we can predict how brick walls behave when they are hit by things. So this issue is not one of the things that is a matter of individual opinion.

The inclusion of the word """"irrational"""" is key to the NPOV and accuracy of this article.
It is rational to be hostile to immigrant populations, this is well supported by evolutionary psychology evidence; to describe this hostility as phobia, one is implicitly making a moral judgement on a behaviour that is widely agreed in science to be instinctive; and thus such a subjective moral connotation is irrational and unjustified.

Unless you think you're a lexicographer, relying on the dictionary immunizes yourself from charges of POV.
Now that it looks like some reform is gonna stick, I am much less unsatisfied than I was when I came upon the article back in June or whenever.  But it is clunky, designed by committee.  I had hoped that enough of you guys would understand the importance of defining time, on the outset, as these two different (and not really competing) definitions, first as a phenomenon (where I drew every word out of the dictionary references, including """"indefinite"""" and """"existence"""", etc.) and then as a measurement (what Steve Quinn likes to call the """"operational"""" definition).  And I had hoped that, because measurement is done both with clocks we build (to measure time in material reality) and with our conscious experience (which is debated among philosophers and lay people as to whether or not that is contained in material reality or is somehow different) that you guys (with the exceptions of SQ and JW) would see the wisdom of not jamming them together in a run-on sentence and see the wisdom of setting up the topic in all three major POVs: Time as phenomenon, Time as physical measurement, Time as experience right away in two lede sentences.  Everything else in the article will fall under one of those three; """"religion, philosophy, and science... business, industry, sports, the sciences, music, dance, and the live theater"""".  I am convinced that the professor would grade my lede definition higher than what is there now, and far better than what was there before.  Too bad.  But the status quo isn't better than what existed before and since I was unsuccessful (even though everything is solidly referenced) in convincing you, I'll let it go.  Unless SQ or JW try to crap up the lede again, then I'll be back, and the rest of us also should be vigilant.  Maybe someday, this will be a good article.  But no matter how well the rest of the article is done, if the lede is crappy, the article as a whole cannot be """"good"""".

 I object to this. It's not a calendar year that the competition runs in, but a football season. While it will be done before the end of 2014, it still takes place within the 2014/15 football season (as shown on the info box below), and when the next season edition (and so on) takes place with a January final, will create an odd situation where there is a 2014 FFA Cup article, then 2015/16, and ongoing 20xx/xx article titles. It is better to standardise them now to a full seasonal date. There is also the possibility that a shift in competition dates over multiple seasons could see a competition run entirely in the first half of the year, followed by another edition of the tournament that starts and finishes in the second half of the year, which would lead to a very odd title situation if we go by a 'calendar year' article title process, eg we could end up with a hypothetical situation of having to disambiguate two editions of the tournament played in the same calendar year despite being in different football seasons.   09:14, 15 May",0,0,0,0,0,0

GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked had put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol

My concern is that an entire article on Billy the Kid was removed for no valid reason. That article not only contained my contributions, but the contributions of others. It contained the most detailed bibliography on Billy the Kid offered yet on Wikepedia. It also included 147 detailed citations. There is no valid excuse for removing that article and substituting the mess that is there now. Blocking me for real or imagined infractions is one thing. Destroying the article that I, and others, had worked long and hard on - and replacing it with an absolute piece of junk - is quite another. You have done extensive work on Wikipedia's Wyatt Earp article. How would you feel if all of your efforts were deleted? What was done to my last version of the Billy Kid article is nothing less than criminal - and that crime is against Wikipedia and all of those unselfish people who have tried to make it a reliable source. The joke is, I considered myself finished with the Billy the Kid article when it was suddenly removed. Now if you, and the others at Wikipedia """"sincerely value your expertise. Wikipedia needs knowledgeable authors like you,"""" as you say. You will restore my last version of the article. Here is my good faith offer: If Wikipedia will restore that article at the point where I last left it, I promise that I will not go near it again. I look forward to the work that your expert editors can do to correct the """"encyclopedic tone,"""" and encourage that effort. I also look forward to submissions and improvements to this article by other Wikipedians. Please note that I have claimed to """"own"""" the Billy the Kid article. All I was trying to do was to provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from. The quickest way to do this is restore the article as it was when it was moved. I have no intention of trying to get it back to that point, by correcting the absolute mess that is up there right now. I trust you and all the forthright editors at Wikipedia to correct the """"encyclopedic tone"""" that you consider lacking. I would also appreciate the removal of those tags that have suddenly appeared at the top of articles I contributed to on Bat Masterson and Luke Short. They suddenly appeared on the Masterson and Short articles at the exact same time my last version of Billy the Kid. It is not that I should be treated differently because of my credentials in the Wild West History field ... the fact is that no one should have to be treated that way. This is childish behavior from those who don't have the best interest of Wikipedia involved.

I'm not so much a proponent of my own version so much as an *opponent* of the use of the meaningless (to the non-mathematical) word """"instantaneous.""""

I don't really mind the differentiation thing being right after the initial sentence, because people might have clicked on the derivative page after going to differentiation (a disambig page).  It's certainly grammatical to say """"Finding a derivative is called differentiation""""; see gerund.  However, now that I think about it, maybe we should just say """"Differentiation is the process of finding a derivative.""""  (We put the sentence in the active voice.)

Your thoughts?

d94e79f60e35f3ca,"Demonising Turks 

It is obvious from certain Wikipedia articles that many people are using it as a vehicle to demonise Turks. Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk. 

It wears thin. 

To be honest, I don't want Turkey to join the EU. I want you and teh editors and admin that are like-minded to carry on with your actions. We need to perpetuate the misnomers and misrepresentation of the Turks. Forget the Royal Academy's exhibition last year about these people. We need to keep isolating them. Because one day you will help in ending your civilisation by cutting such a large chunk of it out. 

I do hope you get what you deserve.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Edit summary 

When editing an article on Wikipedia there is a small field labelled """"Edit summary"""" under the main edit-box. It looks like this:

The text written here will appear on the Recent changes page, in the page revision history, on the diff page, and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article. See m:Help:Edit summary for full information on this feature.

When you leave the edit summary blank, some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted, so please always briefly summarize your edits, especially when you are making subtle but important changes, like changing dates or numbers. Thank you.  

I do, when I'm doing anything more than grammar. The only exception to this would be on Clan Fraser of Lovat, of which I'm the only editor at present, and I didn't think to add edit summaries. Otherwise, I believe that I have done so. If you have any particular situations in which I have failed to do so, I'd be happy to explain myself; I'd much appreciate it.  
See it for yourself: Green bars are for edit summaries, red bars are for edits with no summaries.  
That's quite a nifty tool there. I'm fully aware of edit summaries. I don't provide edit summaries on my own talk page, or my User Page. I also don't usually provide them on other users' talk pages. In earlier editing, I didn't take the summary seriously; if you're referring to anything from several months ago or more, I do apologize. Like I said: if you have any particular situations where you believe I missed one, please bring them up to me. I would sincerely like to know. Otherwise, I don't see what you're trying to accomplish here.  
I think the link speaks for itself.  As for what I'm trying to accomplish, I think my original comment explained just that.  
If you were trying to just helpfully remind me, I thank you, though I don't think it was needed. I saw the page; it didn't say anything to me, except that I finally know my edit count. If you really want to get a point across to me, I suggest you do so blatantly. If your original comment explained your motives, then we are done here.  

 Your """"nonsense"""" page 

If you are interested in archiving your old talk, you may want to review Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page.  Accusing other editors of """"defacing"""" your talk page for politely reminding you of Wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part, and will only make you look bad.  I suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like User talk:Canaen/archive1.  Furthermore, making negative comments about discussion by other editors, and claiming that their edits """"are not worth reading"""" shows that you aren't interested in abiding by  WP:NPA, WP:CIV, nor WP:EQ.  If you want to improve your working relationship with other editors, it might help to avoid incivility.  
I'm not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet, but thank you for the suggestion. I use """"nonsense"""" in a lot of ways other people do not, because I find a lot of other words to be boring at present. Likewise,  instead of """"cool,"""" or """"awesome,"""" or """"that's interesting,"""" I'm currently in the habit of referring to things as """"nifty."""" It's something I do. I know how to archive a talk page, I've done it before. I still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack, because I've grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere. I'm not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words. I thought that this was resolved by now. I have quite decent relationships with other working editors; it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along. It is regretful, but something which seems to be. If someone takes offence to my creation of a Nonsense page, they can bring it up to me personally, as you",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Remaining issues to be addressed 

Some good sources have been added to the article, especially the Mooks article. The local news story is reliable too and goes a small way to support notability under WP:GNG.

Still there are 7 references that are about artists other than the subject of the article. There needs to be a reason to include these other artists which is not immediately clear at this point in time, remembering that notability can't be inherited 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

A source http://www.codenametom.com.au/ doesn't support that Lord's work has been featured in The Design Files magazine.

This source http://thedesignfiles.net/2011/02/mornington-peninsula-home-david-and-lolly-of-codename-tom/ mentions Lord but im not sure it supports that he has been featured per se.

Speedy deletion of Cash Shop
 A tag has been placed on Cash Shop requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. Please see Wikipedia:Stub for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources that verify their content. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

No, the statement is accurate. It's a verfiable fact (for which there's no shortage of evidence) that there are no pro-ID peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals. The only controversy is that created by the Discovery Institute's list, which you first posted here before deleting it.

Discovery Institute claims there are peer reviewed ID articles. But the DI's list has been long debunked:  It's also easily verifiable by searching the relevant scientific pub DBs.

Bray suspects that it may have been the money Bacon gave them that brought the matter to notice: certainly, homosexual relations between masters and servants were clearly common enough to provoke the satirists. As for the weight allotted to it in the article: this is a classic situation in Wikipedia. Any implication of homosexuality in an historical figure has to be detailed and fully referenced beyond normal expectation, otherwise it is then accused of being an unsupported allegation, with the resulting endless edit war. In addition, the earlier point made on this thread about including it: """"Because a significant amount of modern scholarship is focused on how it affected the development of his ontology"""" is extremely valid. The growth of gay studies departments within universities in recent years, and the flood of research and interpretation, is having a significant impact, and is literally re-writing history. To give a tiny example: the discoveries and interpretations in Crompton's 'Byron and Greek Love' have affected every Byron biography published after 1985. Multiply this a thousand times, and one gets an idea of the tsunami of change. For the homophobic this presents a confronting situation, but it's the reality.

 Please read WP:EDITSUMMARY and take your own advice.  To answer your allegations, insinuations and questions:
If you check my contribs, you may note that I'm a slightly busy editor, with far more obligations on Wiki and articles on my watchlist than only Chavez.  When you make an incorrect edit, it pops on my watchlist and I correct it.  Doing any more for now in the current environment of WP:BATTLEGROUND and WP:OWN is not possible.  When/if the article ever settles down to consensual and collaborative editing, I'll be more than happy to devote ample time to article improvement.  As it stands, a well-justified POV tag was placed on the article in February, and not a single editor there did a single thing to correct the POV for months, until the current battleground resumed.  You might ask yourself if you have contributed to the battleground or to a collaborative editing environment, particularly with edit summaries like the one noted above.  In the meantime, I can clean up ten medical articles and promote ten FACs in less time than it takes to settle one clear and simple cn tag on Chavez.
The text clearly says a law was enacted; the cited source cleary says a law may be enacted.  The source does not verify the text an updated source is needed.

 I'm not going to get into a revert war over it; that'd be silly, and I don't even want to think about 1RR or 2RR. I'd rather get your perspective and rationale surrounding it and perhaps (probably) we can see the other's impetus and figure out the best, most logical, and most effective final solution. Moving it wholesale probably isn't it, but having a full screen-page of duplicate info isn't either, I don't (right now) think. I'd like to hear your insights on the matter.

Oversourcing
Hi, I thought I should explain why I reverted the edit you made to Warwick Castle, especially considering it takes a lot less effort to hit the revert button than it does to go through and prune references. I understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs. However, per WP:V """"material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed"""". Therefore I think it's better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph. Moreover, if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source (unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources). So I am sorry to revert your changes, but I am quite happy to discuss it if you still believe the references should be trimmed.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It should be noted that Joseph Ratzinger, ex-conscript in (Adolf) Hitler Youth, announced its resignation as Pope Benedict XVI on february 11th 2013, Benedict of Aniane and Adolf of Osnabrück feast day  Catholic online. February fest days: http://www.catholic.org/saints/f_day/feb.php. Maybe, this should be added in his biography.

Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   
I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink.

 About Disputed ethnic origin of persians 

The papyri from Tebtunis record several sites in the Fayum, which appear to have been founded as ethnic communities in the third century BCE. These include the """"Village of the Syrians"""" (Syrôn kômê), """"Village of the Arabs"""" (Arabôn kômê) and Samareia, which contained a sizable Jewish population and was probably named after the city in Palestine. 

Although ethnic designations like Boeotian, Macedonian, Syrian, Arab and Jew probably refer to geographic origin, """"Persian"""" proves problematic. Its precise origin or significance is disputed. In the early Ptolemaic period it seems to describe people with Greek names functioning in a Greek context; although they enjoy a privileged status, they are counted separately from Greeks in tax lists. In late Ptolemaic and Roman contracts, """"Persian of the epigonê"""" refers to the legal status of a debtor who had waived certain personal rights in order to secure the collection of a debt.

Persians 
6 June 12 BCE
 
In this Demotic contract, summarized in Greek at the bottom, Pakemis son of Pakemis, acknowledges the loan of the dowry of his wife Tameische (Greek, Tameischis), daughter of Sokonopis, and promises to repay it. Here """"Persian"""" does not seem to indicate descent, but describes a man with the status of a debtor. In this example, the subject has an Egyptian personal name, but """"Persian of the epigonê"""" is just as frequently used to describe people with Greek names.

Good point  how does the title relate to the meaning of apartheid? This was discussed somewhat in the centralized Talk and the synthesis. There are two meanings of apartheid: (1st) The official self-described policy of South Africa. (2nd) Similar or analogous policies in other places. The title """"Israeli apartheid"""" uses the 2nd meaning. This seems to favor the anti-Israel side. In the suggestion that started this thread  """"Comparisons between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa"""" the word 'apartheid' has the 1st meaning. This arguably favors the pro-Israel side. But """"Israel and apartheid""""?? Gee, one of the interesting things about """"Israel and apartheid"""" is that the noun 'apartheid' is not modified (either by Israeli or SA).

Talk:Female genital mutilation; please stop
Hi Elvey. I noticed you on Johnuniq's page, which I watch, and was moved to check out the discussion at Talk:Female genital mutilation. Your part of it worried me. While I have no opinion of my own on the statistics, as FGM is not a field I've studied, I see two principles in play on that talkpage, that are true for all articles, and that you seem to pay scant attention to: 

1) Use reliable secondary sources. It's important (for all articles, but more especially for a sensitive subject such as FGM) to be based on reliable secondary sources. Synthesising sources in order to argue, in Wikipedia's voice, with a UNICEF report from 2013 isn't on, unless you have a reliable source (as opposed to having your own synthesis and conclusions from sources) that offers the same argument. 
2) Consensus. Nobody (except partly Vetrisimino0) agrees with you about how the stats should be represented in the article. There is consensus against your section tags, described here as """"overly aggressive"""". I hope the issue of the tags has blown over, but a few days ago you kept restoring them, and defend them aggressively; the fact that the article is being prepped for WP:FAC seems to anger you further, and makes you accuse SlimVirgin of WP:OWN: a serious accusation, which shouldn't be made without good evidence, and which you have taken to SV's user talkpage as well.

Combative and unresponsive discussion sours the editing experience for other users. Everybody else is speaking respectfully to you, as far as I can see; you're the one that has been upping the temperature with posts like this, where you call Zad's comment """"blatantly untrue, not to mention insulting"""" — based, as far as I can see on a mistaken notion that he was impugning some arithmetic you had done (he wasn't). That kind of response reminds me of the old adage about the internet being populated by sensitive and angry people, """"eggshells armed with hammers"""" (Google tells me it was originally said of heavily armed but lightly protected battleships). Please don't jump so quickly to the conclusion that people are insulting you. Worse, your header here is a noxious bad-faith-assuming personal attack, something to be scrupulously avoided in section headers. And you put it as the header to a post by SlimVirgin, which you had moved there from your own talkpage. That is truly awful behaviour, seemingly designed to discourage others and chase them off. (Charming edit summary at your own page, btw.) If you can't stop yourself from getting angrier and angrier whenever you're contradicted (this post, aggressively attacking Johnuniq, is a charming recent example), I advise you to take a break from the article. That's advice. What I tell you, as an uninvolved admin, is that you must stop filling the talkpage with rehashing of arguments that have not carried conviction before, and you must stop attacking people. Your accusation against SlimVirgin that she is """"abusing her position as an administrator to gain advantage in a content dispute"""", currently at the bottom of the page, is made up out of whole cloth as far as I can see. Has she mentioned or hinted at being an admin, or warned you in any way? If I've missed where SV is playing the admin card, tell me where. The word """"disrupt"""", which she used and which looks to be the basis of your accusation, is by no means _ the prerogative of admins.  | talk .

I appreciate that you are trying to improve the encyclopedia by dealing with the conflict at FGM by taking the discussion here.  I wish you'd participate in the discussion of the facts instead.  I feel that in coming here, you raise/reiterate some good points, but I don't think you should be raising the first few, at least, here:
""""*1) Use reliable secondary sources."""" (emphasis is in the original)  I totally agree, and I said that in the discussion, """"The sources are given and reliable and secondary."""" and """"Also apropos """"Anything about prevalence needs a strong secondary source,"""" are you saying that the source we're using for reporting the UNICEF stats in the first place is better?

As the administrator assessing your unblock request, it is no part of my job to assess the validity of either of those evidently sincere opinions. It is, however, my task to assess how you have handled the disagreement. You have refused to consider that there may be genuine, good-faith disagreement, but have instead repeatedly thrown accusations of malice against those who have expressed opinions contrary to yours. You have wikilawyered and twisted and twisted to try to show that you are RIGHT. You have treated Wikipedia as a battleground, where the way to deal with anyone you disagree with is to relentlessly attack them, not as a collaborative environment where the way to deal with disagreements is to discuss with a view to trying to reach agreement. You have persistently refused to accept that Wikipedia works by consensus, not by the person who shouts most  loudly """"RIGHT IS ON MY SIDE"""" gets his or her way. You have attempted to intimidate other editors by suggesting that they might be subject to legal redress.

You have repeatedly and persistently failed to hear what others have said to you when it has not suited your preferred view. You have repeatedly accused other editors of doing exactly the kind of things that I see you doing all the time. I get the impression that you sincerely do not see that you have been doing those things, but that is how it looks to me, viewing the matter as an uninvolved outsider, who had never before heard of this dispute, nor even of the school in question. As you have done with other issues, you wikilawyer over whether what you have done fits your reading of a definition of """"disruptive"""" that you dredge up: I have no interest in responding to that, I simply ask myself """"do this editor's actions disrupt the working of the Wikipedia community?"""" to which the answer is clearly and obviously """"yes, very much so"""".

Considering that your disruptive editing has been continuing over a period of more than three months, I would have blocked you for significantly longer.

Francis, Of course I am open to the consensus of the group (any actual trads involved?).  However, I think your argument is misplaced. Mainstream Roman Catholicism at this time includes a broad cross-section of people with a wide variety of commitment levels, and yet all are considered """"Catholic"""", so I do not think that one can simply compare trads in general with a subset of mainstream Catholics, which we might, for convenience, term """"hardcore.""""  In any event, my vision for this article in general, and for this section in particular, is to present an accurate picture of the persons discussed, who are traditional, or traditionalist Catholics.  Given that, it obvious that some things which are identified with them, such as praying the Rosary frequently or going to Confession often, will also be found among some, more commited, more devout mainstream Catholics.  To address your concerns, I am open to acknowledging in the article that this overlap exists.  However, I think that removing any reference in this article, in this section, to recitation of the Rosary is selling both somewhat short.  There are other things, as well, which could be added, such as a preference for homeschooling (which, again, would not be confined to trads, or even Catholics, but which, I would think, would correlate highly with a traditionalist position.

 Russians in Georgia 

First, here's some statistics (all the Soviet censuses) for Georgia proper, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It's in Russian but you shouldn't have any difficulties with these tables (Russians are """"русские"""" in Russian, just find appropriate columns).

Georgia

Ethnic Russians appeared in Georgia in significant numbers after Georgia became part of the Russian Empire in 1803 (Kartli and Kakheti) - 1878 (Ajara). There were 79082 and 19273 people who indicated Russian as their mother language in Tiflis Governorate  and Kutais Governorate  respectively. Dukhobors have to be mentioned as well.

As you can see from the census data the Russian population had risen from 83 to the maximum of 319 thousand between 1926 and 1959 and then began to decline slowly to 266 thousand in 1989. Migration and lower birth rates were the main reasons of this decline.

Obviously, many Russians left Georgia during the 1990s due to economic hardships (mainly, imho) and other reasons.

In late 2004, and in the midst of a prolific period of Time Cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational Cubic scriptures, Dr Ray took the Cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level, by solving the major philosophical question: """"Why something rather than nothing?"""" The answer, as published by him on his Time Cube website, related to the principle of opposites (in this case, static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites), an important element of Cubic geometry: """"Between the opposites, all things are created. As an entity, they exist only as a big zero, seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.""""

It appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for """"Why something rather than nothing?"""", so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. Thus, when the solution is revealed, they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the Cubic Truth, which, as we know, disproves God and exposes religion as an evil Word-scam. 

It seems a pity, but in reality, great things don't come easy. We must all fight to break the Word-shackles of religious and Academic-induced 1-corner ignorance, and force teachers to teach Cubicism above evil cubelessness. Humanity's sole hope of salvation lies with 4-corner Cubic knowledge.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your edit on National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma 

I hate to bring this up, but I don't care if the content you removed from National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma was relevant or not; the edit summary you left was, in my opinion, inaccurate, and, more importantly, was really insulting to me. You shouldn't just remove everything that makes the office unique; how's it different from every other office then? Undoubtedly, some of that information was in fact irrelevant or excessive, but instead of actually doing anything to help the article, you have done nothing more than strip it down. I know that you have made some great contributions to the wiki, but that edit summary was kind of like a slap to the face. If the content you removed was entirely non-unique and useless, then your edit summary might have been a bit more justified, but that was most certainly not the case. I'm not going to call you lazy or insult you (I don't think you're lazy, that's not what I am implying), but I am going to say that you could have done better. I've dealt with enough of this sort of gesture. Through all of this, I am trying to remain as civil as possible, but if you are going to say that you don't like the article as is, make more of it than simply stripping it down. There are other areas of the office's history which I would far rather expand upon, but I would likely be heavily restricted in terms of finding non-primary sources. I hate WP:PRIMARY enough; that's one of the reasons I been dealing with many problems from some editors. That's part of what forced me to userfy the page, which in turn is part of the reason for which next to no editors aside from myself have edited the article. No one wants to edits a user space draft apart from the relevant user. That's why I have received little input on the article. In any case, please just be kinder in the future; I intend no offense here, and I will admit that there were and are problems with the article, but please do not just go around removing cited content without also helping to build as well. Please don't take any offense or think me """"foolish"""" or something (I don't know what you will think when you read this) like some editors would. I don't want this to be some sort of major issue in the future; I just really don't want this to happen again. Please take all of this to mind.

It is essential that the Able Danger debate be carried out in the places where it is relevant.  It is simply not relevant here.  If you can find legitimate news sources or counterterrorism analysts who provide a justification for its relevance here then it will be worth considering but right now it has no relevance whatsoever.  Your speculation about the credibility of the 9/11 Commission on issues not addressed by Able Danger is just pure speculation.  From someone, I might add, whose own credibility is very much in question.  I will continue to delete references to Able Danger until someone establishes their relevance in a meaningful way, not through a string of random speculations barely tied together by a thread like the above.  And again, let us please remember that the 9/11 Commission is not the issue here anyway.  The commission is cited but the pieces of evidence they look at are all pieces of intelligence brought out by other agencies.  As for the arrest of Iraqis in Germany, again, if you find evidence or even authoritative speculation tying those arrests to Able Danger we can consider it - otherwise it is just a string of increasingly bankrupt attempts at pseudo-logic. 05:11",0,0,0,0,0,0

b)  if you do not like the complete data nor the corrected references, will you please explain why and how I can improve to meet wikipedia standards?  

Tis quite odd that corrected detailed facts and references continue to be deleted, and replaced with incomplete detail and incorrect references... am confident wikipedia.org would prefer the former, not the later.   If this is wrong, please explain why.

If you are deleting corrected facts and corrected references,  and continue to refuse to communicate factual reasons for this,  I will then need to report your unprofessional actions to your supervisors and colleagues.

 re:Image:AnotherVersionofthePast.jpg 

I saw your post to ^demon regarding this image. I cannot undelete the image because of WP:FUC #3.b. The image has not been reduced in size. I also believe it fails #2 in that it directly competes with the commercial opportunities of the copyright holder. #8 is also jumping out at me, because the summarized text in the article serves the same purpose as the image. There is not critical commentary about the design of the sight or visual representation of the image in the article Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game. Therefore, the exact image you uploaded isn't appropriate for use on wikipedia, and a cropped or reduced size image may theoretically be appropriate, but in the proposed article would just be decorative (and against out non-free content policy). Sorry, but I hope this explanation helps.- [talk] 
Thanks very much for the reply.  I understand your Fair-Use concerns, and hopefully I can address all of them.
FUC 3.b - Agreed.  If the image is undeleted I'd be happy to reduce it's size and upload the smaller version, but I can't really do that (download the high resolution version) until it is undeleted.
FUC #2 - There are no commercial opportunities at stake here.  Because of the odd nature of the website, as part of an alternate reality game, the only logical copyright holder would be either Nine Inch Nails, 42 Entertainment, or Interscope records.  No one is making any money off of these websites: in fact, they officially have absolutely no connection to any company, not even to the album (Year Zero (album)) that it is parallel to.  Reznor himself has stated the ARG is NOT a promotional device.  (see Year Zero (alternate reality game) for more info on that)
FUC #8 - Although the dates themselves are similar, the text is not.  The whole point of the originating website, Another Version of the Past is that there are multiple perspectives of past events.  The text in the WP article is a dry, point-for-point account: """"neutral"""" if you will.  The two versions of the time line presented on the website represent both extremes of the fictional issues at hand: pro-American, pro-government, etc and on the other hand extremist, rebellious, reformatory, etc.  The image provides the user an opportunity to see the POV/agendas at work and compare it to what actually happened.  For example the New Orleans floods are described as a """"Faith-based disaster"""" on one hand, and """"Why Bother with New Orleans?"""" on the other.  
I still believe the image wouldn't be appropriate here. The site the image came from is copyrighted, and was used to promote the album (for the record company executives), regardless what Reznor said, so FUC#2 still concerns me, and I'm not convinced of FUC#8 either. We can simply quote snippets of text without showing it if we want to discuss how the timeline is presented. We'd need to discuss visual aspects of how things look in order to show an image, IMO. I have asked another admin who is more versed in image policy to comment here, so be patient for a 2nd opinion. Thanks for your reply.- [talk] 

Greetings. I was asked to comment here. This image is essentially text, with decorative flourishes. As such, I don't see how  it could pass WP:NFCC#8, which requires that a non-free image provide encyclopedic information beyond what text alone could convey. I don't believe that the text alone, quoted, would be less informative than the image. (And I think that much text, quoted verbatim, would be a copyright violation, which is another indicator that this image isn't allowed.) All the best, –  (talk) (random) 
Ok, fair enough.  I know better than to argue with two admins. =)  Thanks for taking the time to review the case.

Just for reference, there's nothing wrong with citing non-English sources as long as they satisfy WP:RS, but if you do then it's sometimes helpful to provide a brief translation of the relevant section per WP:RSUE. This can be added to the citation template using the  parameter (See Template:Cite web#Quote). Translations do not have to be professional quality; They just have to be sufficient enough for the reader to understand how the cited source supports what is written in the article. 
Regarding COI, you are considered to have a conflict of interest because you have stated you are an employee of the museum at User talk:Materialscientist#Ottoneum. That doesn't mean you can never edit the article, but it does mean there are certain limitations placed the type of edits which are considered OK for you to make. COI editing is not expressly prohibited, but it can be a bit tricky to do so it is something which is highly discouraged. It might be a good idea for you to take a look at WP:PSCOI to see what these kinds of edits are. Of course, what you know about the museum is true, but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to Wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject. The information on the museum's official website is considered to be a primary source, so it's usage is rather limited. Wikipedia articles are not really supposed to reflect what a source says about itself or what those connected to the source say about it; Rather, articles are supposed to reflect what independent reliable sources say about something.

I like that you started with a clear definition of a Preparator and Art Handler and next described the responsibilities of the role.

I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager, in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparator and Art Handler. For example, the last Preparator who worked for me was also responsible for helping prep and customize the storage areas, photographing objects (as part of cataloging) and exhibition installations, and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition, which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions. As you described I often engaged outside art handlers when I had to move a lot of art quickly, such as when the museum’s board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare.

Another great reference for professional Preparators and Art Handlers is the Preparation, Art Handling, Collections Care Information Network (PACCIN )

With the recent purge of content, the page is not as informative as it once was.  The biggest problem is the first section which had the  """"proposed benefits of basic income"""" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.  Both of those topics have good quality """"blog classifiable"""" sources available.

In order to Be Bold, I would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content, including from sources that are not government funded.  Basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda, and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article, and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening.  Barring this broadened content eligibility, we all need guidance for what is eligible content, and perhaps what makes naturalfinance.net ineligible.  (The content there was written in 2011, and has been adopted, whether independently or without attribution, by other authors)

Here is the major recent deletion https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_income&diff;=595677190&oldid;=595667344 .  Specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced.  Some of these can be sourced elsewhere, but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted:   

Proposed Benefits

naturalfinance.net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income:
 Wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don't spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do.
 Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.
 Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened
 Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.
 Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.
 Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.
 Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.
 Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.
 It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.
 Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.

My guess would be the listing of the vandals IP address in the comment. If this is the reason I don't especially mind, although I would be interested in knowing which Wikipedia user utilizes that IP if you have the ability to use checkuser on them.

Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are.

Please read reliable sources and explain how the NU Journal of Discovery passes the test.   
 Sorry, I forgot who we are dealing with here, the Arrogant Science Party. How do you propose the theory should be linked to this topic, so people can read about alternative views? 

It isn't a theory. A theory is a scientifically acceptable body of principles that explain phenomena in a reasonable manner. People can read alternative views in thousands of blogs, pseudoscience pieces (books, movies, internet). They have no place in an encyclopedia that relies on reliable, verifiable sources. Cheers   

Your definition is incorrect. Einsteins theory of relativity wasn't accepted at all when he presented it, but it was still a quite valid theory. History is full of people rejected by people with your attitude...   

To be quite honest, were not as stupid as people back in the 15th century. We can actually prove these things with exploration and tests. They couldn't. The world CANNOT explode as a result of Global Warming. Its alot tougher than all these enviromentalists give it credit for, however we can't. It would take some extreme heat to cause any harm to the planet. Just because CO2 levels are at there highest in 20 odd million years doesn't mean the earths getting hotter. It means that we're making CO2. Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years. Unless we find a way to turn the air into a thick layer of greenhouse gases, the earth will never heat up more than 10 or so degrees, no matter how long you wait.

The storm tide in Mississippi was typically 20-32 feet (10-m) high after 4 hours, gutting 3rd-floor rooms, while in New Orleans, the tide was less than 7 feet (2 m) from being on the weak (west) side of the eye-path.  The levee system, raised to 23-feet high, would have been swamped 8 feet under by the Mississippi tide that flooded 12 miles inland.

Also, just before landfall, Katrina's eyewall replacement cycle miraculously reduced wind-speed from a Hurricane-Camille force down to only 125 mph (200 km/h), which might have shattered most windows in the French Quarter, but the wind subsided.  The 50,000 left in New Orleans could have faced a gushing sea of broken glass, but instead, saw slowly rising water for days, and had time to leave or wait for evacuation help from FEMA.

 Horrendous Inaccuracies 

I think there should be something in this article about how inaccurate conservapedia is. Just look at their article on England [England]: http://www.conservapedia.com/England 

It's just nonsense-  Wales and Cornwall were """"independent Pictish kingdoms"""" under Roman rule!!! 
The Picts were from Scotland; Wales and Cornwall, not to mention England, didn't even exist until after the Romans left; all of modern day England, Wales and Cornwall were under Roman rule. I wouldn't even say I had a great knowledge of history, but I know that much.

If anyone had any other examples of ludicrous inacurracies in these sort of articles (ie not related to evolutin/ religion/ other typical conservative bugbears) could you post them here, along with any citations from newspapers or blogs pointing out inaccuracies.

Paglia: On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism. 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture.

 Re your block of User:Witysmartone 

Hi, just wondering why you only blocked for 24 hours?  If you look at the contribs that user has failed to make a single constructive edit so far - normally that warrants an indefinite block?    
Nothing too mysterious. ) The user was only active for about 40 minutes, in all. In my experience with basic vandal accounts, the duration of the block only rarely makes any difference in practice. Most times, they never return even after a short block. In the event they do return, they'll either continue disrupting the project (in which case it's easy enough to re-block) or will contribute helpfully (in which case we're better off than when we started); in the former case, the indefinitely blocked vandal will be quite able to return using another account, anyway, so the term """"indefinite"""" can be a bit misleading. If there is a danger in this strategy, it's in allowing a number of iffy accounts to sit around autoconfirmed, but we tend to do that already, with a few thousand every day. –

Every second year the Falcon is going to be replaced. It's a difficult situation because Ford Motor Company Australia is the last Australian designed and manufactured company that isn't working on the base chassis and running gear that FoMoCo USA is putting out. Truth be told, the Ford Falcon is the ONLY remaining Australian car (which I didn't see mentioned in the article, I'll address this in a sub thread).

However, OP is correct. The EA and EA 30th anniversary model and mk ii were possibly one of the most reliable of Ford Falcon's releases, the fuckers used to push up to 600,000 on the odo before engine parts started to fail. Many taxi used variants rolled the clock over, I remember seeing a mates hit the big 0's on all original parts, and owned a 30th as my first car.

That being said, the Taurus would never compete, it's too expensive and too shit. FoMoCo AU left the EF in the microwave a bit too long and it resulted in AU's. Some of those were washed with cold water and shrunk into what they termed the Taurus. 211.30.150.155  00:49, 9 December 2011",0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah well, I've corrected the paragraph twice and if you want me to do it a third time you need to pay me. Stating that people with albinism also can have nearsightedness and farsightedness is like saying people with pneumonia can also have a clubbed foot. When you list signs and symptoms of a disease, you limit them to the ones that are caused by or associated with the specific disease. Astigmatism is on the cornea, more rarely in the internal lens, and is an error of refraction. It has absolutely nothing to do with the pigment in the retinas. Albinism is a lack of pigment, the cornea doesn't need pigment to develop properly. The fovea, however, needs a normal RPE to develop properly. It isn't actually known why, but we do know this to be the case. In order to save myself time looking each fact up, I will just cite the most encyclopedic text and I'm sure every one of these points is there. However, you can't just point to one sentence and say """"here it is"""" you actually have to study the entire book to get an understanding of all this information. For example, you are never going to find one sentence in any text that states specifically that """"albinos have the same prevalence of nearsightedness as the regular population."""" No text would ever say that. They would say in one spot what albinism is, and in another spot say what nearsightedness was, and leave it up to the reader to understand the two have nothing to do with each other. Otherwise they would have to say in the description of each disease all the other thousands of diseases that have nothing to do with it. Would I look up pneumonia and find a specific sentence, """"pneumonia has nothing to do with clubbed foot."""" It seems to me that the original writer needs to cite a reference that albinism is associated with refractive errors, and if not, it just needs to be deleted. I can't cite a reference for a null, I can't cite a reference for someting I deleted. Do I just leave a blank line and cite why it's not there?

 First sentence  painfully misguided 

A week is a time unit equal to seven days, used by the Jews at least since the time of Abraham[1], who probably lived between 2000 BCE and 1630 BCE[2].

OK, let us count the ways this makes no sense.

1) """"used by the Jews at least since the time of Abraham""""  since Abraham is the earliest figure in the Old Testament whom one might reasonably call a Jew, the """"at least"""" makes no sense.

2) Abraham to the best of my knowledge is not recorded in Genesis as using a calendar of any sort. The citation attached this statement refers to Moses, an entirely different figure.

3) Abraham is a legendary figure who may or may not have existed, and who is only referred to in the books of the bible, written hundreds or thousands of years after his supposed death.  I don't want to start a fight on religion, but his historicity is certainly up for debate, and a citation of a 100-year-old encyclopedia from a religious institution based in part the Abraham narrative isn't really a reliable source.

Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the 'proper' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal's standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal's aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal's overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He's not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That's not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It's quite clear that he's an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume? Thanks for letting me vent. I just believe in being clear, in communicating, and in helping people to learn to be better Wikipedia contributors.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Copyright violation at Sarat Chandra Pandit 

Avoiding copyright problems
Hello, and welcome. Your addition to Sarat Chandra Pandit has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material to Wikipedia without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source if public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to visit me at my talk page .  Thank you. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""""Ethnical cleansing""""? Dear child, there was a different policy towards those Italians who dirtened their hands against locals (Croats, Slovenians...) and towards those that didn't.
Otherwise, if Yugoslavia had as a goal to make ethnic cleansing of Italians, how come that Italians had their partisan brigade (and that was in every schoolbook), that there were memorial plaques (dedicated to Italians that joined to partisans) all over Croatia (Garibaldi brigade, if I remember well), that Italians had and have their TV-station in Slovenia, that Italians had and have their newspapers (and publishing house) and theatre and organizations in Croatia? 
Second, don't mix those who escaped because of their feeling of guilt, or those who knew that they'll be punished (for their fascist activities and crimes against locals) with persons (manyof them Croats) who used opportunity to leave for the West and avoid advancing Communism. Oh, by the way, did Italy processed fascist officials? We've processed all those that collaborated with nazists and fascists (with very severe penalties, death penalty or losing or being stripped of all citizen rights wasn't rare case). Oh, speaking about """"cleansing"""". How many Italians were colonized into Slovenia and Croatia (on occupied and annected areas, on Eastern Adriatic)? 
Do you know for the data, that Italian authorities have brought personnel (teachers, artisans, engineers) from Italy into annected and occupied areas, in order to ensure functioning of system (and at the same time increasing the number of Italians there), becaue the locals have boycotted schools (and teachers and pupils) and work in factories?

 Tyrannosaurus FA 

Hi Sandy, I was wondering if you would have a quick look at the Tyrannosaurus article and see if it looks to you to meet current FA standards?  I am wondering whether to initiate a discussion on it with a view towards it needing an FA review as the text to me seems repetitive, handling of units hap-hazard and inconsistent, significant overlinking, and needing some reorganisation.  I would welcome any thoughts you may have, and to be clear I am not asking that you take on the job, I just seek the view of an experienced FA contributor.  Thanks.    
 Hi, EdChem ... I'm sorry I have been of so little use in responding to your requests for help lately !  I've been quite busy in real life, so haven't had the time for the sustained commitment needed to review at the FA level, although I can occasionally dip in to DYK for a quick source review.  (Will respond to Tony's DYK issue as soon as I can I'm more concerned about sourcing, padding, and copyvio issues than how interesting hooks are at DYK I think interesting hooks might be a concern if the basic pillars of Wikipedia were being met, and I'm concerned that DYK is still a place where not even basic pillars that apply to all articles are upheld.)   When I was new to Wikipedia, dinosaur articles were all the rage; as often happens, it seems that many of the editors who maintained those articles have moved on.  At a quick glance, I can see numerous problems (as you outlined, including uncited text) with the article, but those problems aren't as bad as many older FAs that typically appear at WP:FAR.  It's not surprising that a high-profile topic like tyrannosaurus would deteriorate after its principle editors move on. Instructions at FAR ask that editors post to the talk page before initiating a review, in hopes that some interested editor will improve the article and remove the need for FAR.  You cannot go wrong by listing some of the obvious issues on talk to see if anyone will surface to work on the article.  If no one surfaces in say a month, I agree that the article probably needs to go to FAR.  But there are so many FAs in so much worse shape ... I digress )  Best,  (Talk)

Thanks for the reply. The Arbcom's ruling, to my reading, did not take a position on the issue of categorization. Categorization based on religion and sexual orientation are, quite rightly, singled out with additional criteria that do not apply to information in the text of an article.

If using hubs there is a limit imposed by the need for a collision to be detected everywhere, iirc it's officially two hubs for fast ethernet (though in practice you may get away with more due to shorter than required delays in the hubs) but hardly anyone uses hubs anymore so this is largely irrelevent in modern network design. Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn't a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols.
Practically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will """"fail open"""" and end up broadcasting traffic they don't know where to send to the whole network.

 Real truth Kargil WAR 
""""kargil war had two phases""""

Kargil war on the ground (phase one):
Pakistan gave stick to Indian forces and showed them the gutter. President Musharraf was the hero of this war. Indian lost thousands of elite soldiers without achieving anything. There were minimal Pakistani casualties and Pakistan gained control over huge areas (most peaks in the area) with Indian forces in Kashmir vulnerable. 

Kargil war on the table (phase two):
India complained to USA, Nawaz was called by Clinton and Nawaz (God knows for what reason) surrendered and thus agreed to withdraw from all areas Pakistan gained (hence in effect making a victorious war into a lost war). Actually, Nawaz declared to Clinton that all occupying Kashmir on Indian side were not Pakistani soldiers (thus denying them status as Pakistani soldier), regardless, Nawaz also agreed that he will use his influence on them to make them retreat. During this retreat (or withdrawal), Pakistan lost number of men that volunteered in this war.

Result:
Pakistan won the war on the ground (phase one) and lost the war on the table (Phase two).

Speedy deletion of Galaxy Flame
 A tag has been placed on Galaxy Flame requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics.

NOT BEING NEUTRAL & CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Blackpearl14 does not understand what vandalism is, and wrongly calls anyone who contributes per the polices of wikipedia a vandal.  She is not neutral and is in complete conflict of interest.  Based on Blackpearl4's own posting comments about herself, she believes Wikipedia is her forum and that she is owner and controller of anything to do with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.  When you complain about her actions, she wrongly calls you things, like saying you are attacking her and such.  

NOTE: Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She  celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages?   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral.  Sorry if your feelings are hurt,  but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.

Since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of intere",0,0,0,0,0,0

Anma seriously you really have some issues that need to be addressed. Although I have spoken to other editors, they have been professional and helpful whereas you have been incredibly insulting, plus your behavior is considered harassment (even if Wikipedia defines it differently, I know and trained in these matters and this does qualify, and at the end of the day that will overrule any website). Somehow you always seem to be on top of things should a change be made on the YCDTOTV page. Which leads me to think you are indeed watching the page, and you are probably the original author and a huge fan of the show, and you don't like the idea of someone else coming in and editing or adding on to your work. I'm sorry but you are behaving like a bully. You're right my comment was not a threat, but it is a warning not necessarily for Wikipedia but for the real world. At some point someone will put their foot down and say enough is enough this behavior is inappropriate and there will be consequences. You can't act like this it is called a power trip.

All edits were based on information provided by authorative sources.  Your revert was based on your understanding of your opinion and therefore makes Wikipedia a useless effort.

Links to the authorative websites for the councils is appropriate. See Crater Lake link is allowed but Oregon Pacific, Cascade Pacific, Blue Mountain, etc are not?  Oregon Council links are not allowed but California is?

Information by district corrections were removed? . . the correct information was updated from the authorive websites of the Councils.  Do you not check the information before you delete or correct?

Again, the worth of a wiki is it's accuracy. . . by external validated resources. Each link was provided for your review.  Take some time, get off the Code REd and, spend sometime reviewing the information.—The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

 A """"hint of longing?"""", a """"HINT of longing?""""  It's more like an avalanche of teenage angst because your crush won't reciprocate! 

a melancholic song about unrequited love, especially because it’s all crescendo and no denouement: Listeners never find out if the main character actually gets her wish—much less if the person she’s confessing her love to actually feels the same way. “All I Want For Christmas Is You” is a one-sided confession of wants and desires, not a song describing or celebrating a consummated relationship. “Honestly, the lyrics, to me, come off as hopelessly sad,” Williems says.  “I’ve read the critical reception section of the song’s Wikipedia page, and I can’t help but think the critics weren’t really listening. One critic seems to claim there is a ‘hint of longing,’ which might be the understatement of the century.

If you wanted to get real bummed about it, I think the argument could be made that the song is denouncing the artificiality surrounding the spectacle of Christmas,” he continues. “Saying that you are so hung up on the negative of not being with one person on Christmas that you can’t embrace the joy of the holiday is really pretty sad, but also movingly honest for a pop Christmas song.

 AMA Request 

Hi, thanks for contacting me. My problem is with User:Tigermichal over the article Deja Vu (Beyoncé song).

Basically, I haven't added anything to the page, I was just watching it. There was some paragraphs on the page about how Beyonce's fans had a petition for a reshoot for the video, and one about the song """"underperforing"""" at radio compared to her last singles, and Tigermichal kept removing them, while I kept putting them back because it's Point of View to not have them, and I think it's encyclopedic to keep them. The petition was mentioned on the TV show Extra, and the other one (which has been readded now) is just explaining the charts. So after I did a few reverts and told Tigermichal of the problem, he went after me, so I went for help.

It's not that big of a deal, and I've just ignored that page now anyways, I just think this user is a bit problematic, especially if you look at his talk page...

My concern about your username (Admiinship is no big deal)

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

 It exemplifies contemporary online chat that is not consensus edited
 The data mass is fragmented in spontaneous posts from different writers in near-random order with at present only a crude indexing by desk subject

 A hypothesis by several respected editors is that we are seeing an evolutionary change in English usage of ITS and IT'S. I think we have a golden opportunity to apply Scientific method here. There is a prediction that can be verified quantatively.

 What proportion of educated speakers combat the orthodox spelling?
 What is the threshold for an contra-orthodox language trend to enter or change orthodox English, given the unprecedented speed of dissemination online and into Wikimedia?

cade9e425d75948e,"Agent X2: Basically thanks - with a 'little' more 

(Little has to be a bit more in this case. It just lies in the nature of the matter.)

First: English is not my native language, so I won't correct the article myself. I rely on others to do that for me, based on my suggestions. Again, I am a german dissident and as a man with a technical background, I do not only have years-long experience with most probably driving around a hidden GPS/GSM bug and the consequences of this arrangement. I also have the ability to become aware of it, although I have to rely on many 'strange observations' which after months of further observation and consideration start to make sense, if you explain them the way I have.

I had prepared a comprehensive letter yesterday summarizing the present situation of the article - i e before your recent changes. For ease of work, let me copy and paste it here, erasing only the sentences that have no more meaning at all. The rest therefore is still true, more or less:

First, I'm not quite sure what implications the 'Articles lacking sources'
classification has. There sure is a lot more to say and show about this
subject, but I think it is already now safe to say that we've got a case. So
what about removing it from this kind of probably discriminatory category? I
suspect that presently it looks like a kind of 'crackpot' article and
therefore doesn't really invite others to join. Would there be a more
suitable 'wanted' category?

Second, we do agree that these appliances exist, and that they also can be
abused. Experience tells you, if something can be abused, it also will.
Experience also tells you, that government agencies are no exception when it
comes to this kind of things. What we need are more details about their (i e
the presumed LEC = military version) size, sensitivity (with respect to the
concealed places they can be attached to) and battery life-span (assuming
they're not installed, just stuck with a magnet or some dough-type
fastener). In the discussion, I gave the URL of a leading german maker of
these objects and tried to draw your attention to the fact that their folder
directed to the LEC is password-protected *), while the material for the
general market is on open display. Would that ring a bell with you?

Third, I would like to see several changes in the article. I'll enumerate
and motivate them in a separate message - see below.

Fourth, I'd like to join everybody into the discussion who is interested in
this subject and can contribute something reasonable (or maybe knows someone
who can). My idea is, this is not just an electronic gadget issue, this is a
civil rights concern. Do you see any other faculties involved, besides
electronics and human rights? How do we spread the word among them? Again,
we need to remove all the discriminatory  classifications from the article
for others to join.

) For your convenience, let me quote that sentence: 'Have you especially
seen my remark regarding the password-protected folder at
http://www.fugon.de/ , expressively directed towards the german LEC ('BOS')?
Wouldn't you agree that this most probably is where all the REALLY
INTERESTING stuff could be found?!? Enigma...'

Third: Desired changes to the article

Foreword: ok

Types of GPS trackers:

I've been informed that they don't necessarily limit temselves to SMS, when
transmitting. Another option would probably be to use GPRS - one of the
wider used packet-switched data transmission modes in cellphone systems.

It is also here that we ought to mention that they are used for tracking
down criminals. I've sent you proof of that. See the discussion page where I
quoted the two media article discussing the german constitutional court's
verdict on GPS/GSM bugs dating back to 4/05.

It ought to be mentioned in that same chapter that there is reason to
believe that there also exist more 'professional' versions for the use
through the military, LEC etc, which are probably smaller, more sensitive
(can be placed 'anywhere' and still work, without external antennas) and
have a long battery life-span.

Potential abuse of GPS trackers:

What is said in the box is basically correct. Could it be re-formulated in a
way to provoke people's interest, rather than stir a feeling for lack of
trustworthiness? Something along the line that 'these are military-style
secrets thus hard to ascertain; anyone from inside this business having
doubts about their ultimate legitimacy should feel invited to",0,0,0,0,0,0

GITHUB is the top place where new computer projects are created and discussed by computer programmers. Anything that isn't right gets corrected pretty fast. For over two years the PyPrimes speed test which is open source has had not one person question the results and since it is open source anyone can download the core of Python a major new computer language and run PyPrimes and test all the various prime algorithms. Every algorithm lost to the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, every one but Prime Spirals.

Now, outside of that real world test, the average mathematician or computer programmer is pretty much clueless as to primes and how they really interact in the modern world today (ie. Cryptology).

Now I could have used a ton of links to NPOV and alternative sites where for 20 years you have various groups arguing what this new algorithm means for the world. In fact much of the original argument was erased from Usenet in the 1990's, and the only group that could have done that was the NSA. 

Since the original algorithm was released when the NSA still controlled encryption related publishing (original paper was 1995) NO PUBLISHING COMPANY would have touched anything claiming to be how this algorithm made all encryption OBSOLETE, that was the original paper, saying to the world in 1995, here world, here is where every prime number above 5 MUST BE, there are only 8 Prime Spirals, now your whole concept of encryption has been DESTROYED by this work.

So, this prime algorthm was tied to national security issues in 1995, and in 1995 the NSA had a headlock on all academic publishing and guess what they still do today, who funds the AMS and the top journals? THE NSA

Now my original article didn't go this deep into why in 1995, this work could not be published in academia due to the NSA chokehold on academic publishing for anything that could possibly be used to create new encryption or damage old encryption.

Now 99.99% of the world is clueless that PRIMES are a big deal in crypto.

A HUGE DEAL

So understanding where they all exist and on what spirals they exist, you can now do neat tricks, like create huge seed keys for ECC crypto that gives the person that creates such a seed key a backdoor to that crypto, oh no, now we're talking about the heart of the issue WIKI LEAKS is all about crypto and how the NSA has a special skeleton key to the seed keys released by NSA projects like NIST and ENISA (europes equivalent).

Now in 1995 to 1999 or so this was discussed in many thousands of pages all over usenet, try to find them now, most are gone, now I actually participated in that era in some usenet discussions about the ENNISA paper, you cannot find one thread now mentioning ENNISA from the 1990's.

So erased all the discussion in math and physics groups about ENNISA?

Yet, if you really know where to look, you can find some references to the work, not ENNISA but the person's name and some of the the actual math still exists.

Now, the math is in books, who published the books, the guy that released it has his own publishing company and it was done via ebooks.

So I have a copy of the ebook. I know it's real.

Now today you have academics taking credit for bits and pieces of his work, and they are 100% controlled sock puppets of the NSA.

So the NSA is now controlling what the public learns about this discovery 20 years after the fact it was released via usenet.

One of the new algorithms is the Atkin sieve, look who published it with Atkin, the guy that sued the US Government in the 1990's to allow software to be published without interference of the NSA.

Look at the guys wiki page, he was tutored by the guy that actually created ECC, the stuff the NSA is using to backdoor all encryption today.

So 1995, the guy is suing the US Gov and 10 years later he is at AMS as the co-author of one of the 3 prime algorithms discussed in ENNISA in 1995.

Just google NSA and AMS, see all the NSA funding.

Just like when academics rebelled in the 1980's against the stranglehold the NSA had on crypto, guess what the NSA did, they bought out all of academia with grants.

Now I'm not a tin foil hat guy/girl, I'm retired, I was in academia and I can actually discuss stuff about math and how academia works and how various topics were taboo in the 1970's through the 1990's.

So AMS MAA AMA, etc, all are now in bed with grants and funding from the NSA.

You look at sieve of Atkin and who is on the paper the kid that sued the government over crypto software in the 1990's, who was groomed by the daddy of ECC now the top crypto used",0,0,0,0,0,0

The only """"major controversy"""" is that on this Wikipedia page, the denialists, such as Duesberg and his followers, those whose ramblings are linked out to from this page, and who have had their long-disputed and dismissed theories and misinformation floating around on he web for many years, were being used as the sole source of 'credible' information on the larger controversy around AIDS and poppers  until I happened upon it.  From the first edit I made, I was almost immeditely reversed, and edited.  Within hours of that first contribution, I was being threatened and censored.  Ultimately, I was blocked, charged with violating unknown-to-me 'rules' of Wikipedia, and otherwise censored, and rendered unable to contribute.  And, that, gentlemen, is what I've been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia.

It would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.

However, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here, and based on the news accounts last month on CNN, ABC Nightly News, and elsewhere, which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that I've been subjected to.

This is a statement regarding your block. First of all, I am the one who has been Wikipedia stalked for over one year now by none other than Delicious Carbuncle, who gave messages through her edits. She followed every single edit and deleted EVERYTHING. She is Pauline Berry and I can provide her IP address if you do not believe me.

She has been too obvious for everyone. I am not accusing her, I have disproved her already with facts. She has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. She edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend's website, which is also a commercial website, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD's on eBay. 

Next stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his fakes.

I am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is defaming me on her page, you did not see this?

She claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edits are telling a different story. 
Next the Name of the Rose. She followed me twice now into that one. I was shooting 14 days for this movie and my part was 'Jorge's Novice and that was named after the monks, who most of them did not have a speaking part at all. Pauline Berry aka Delicious Carbuncle aka 'Restawhile'  followed me to Wikipedia (since she has Internet stalked me for the past three yearssince she is financed by none other than Mark Roesler, one of the defendants in the biggest exhibition fraud in history.)
I am pointing out the facts here. 

She is having a speedy deletion fest and she acts as if she is in charge of running the show. She is not. She cannot turn 100% costume fabrications into original Marilyn Monroe worn costumes, and she tried on her blogs to make sense, because she is part of the project and she is making money off of that fraud.

Now you may think that this edit by Delicious Carbuncle is just 'coincidence' or has nothing to do with Pauline Berry, but until we do not find out who truly is behind Delicious Carbuncle I would ask for fairness in this case and I am asking you to also block this person who has been publicly slandering me, with false accusations, with hypocrite statements and simply with lies.

Now I am aware of the fact that they are working in high numbers, and that it is possible that you, blueboy are part of the group who are supporting a mean and sick fraud project which is out and created solely to defraud the paying public with some foolish fabrications.

Delicious Carbuncle's edit which is a message to Ernest W. Cunningham and Jennifer J. Dickinson.

You be the judge if this is just 'coincidence.'

Please be fair and also block Delicious Carbuncle from further edits. 

You, Blueboy96 state this one: 'True or not, attempting to out another user is beyond unacceptable. Indefblocked. Blueboy96' 

Did you look at Delicious Carbuncle and realize what this person is doing there?!

This edit was posted on Delicious Carbuncle's site and once she realized that she gave herself away, she edited over it, yet I saved it on time.

You have to know that I called up Mrs. Pauline Berry in order to ask her to stop stalking me and to stop supporting one fraud after another. She is a 45 year old musician who also does try Marilyn Monroe imitations from time to time. She asked me years ago for my opinion as an expert on some Marilyn Monroe autographs and I gave he my honest opinion and told her right away that the signed photographs she claimed to have purchased were 100% fakes. She did not take that too well and ever since she is referring to me a 'self proclaimed expert,' she has spent years now on her hateful postings, websites filled with character assassination attempts, comparing me to murderers Charles Manson and John Lennon killer Mark Chapman. Pauline Berry is supporting people who used AIDS infected blood within their intimidation emails and threats. Who threatened to come to my home and burglarize me, harm me, tie me onto a chair and steal my collection. Pauline Berry has been a big part on the public defamation on three people.

Please read the edits of Delicious Carbuncle and see the message. She is referring to my calls to her home, when I attempted to find out why she is supporting criminals.

Who else would this be, instead of Pauline Berry, since only she knew at the time, that I actually called?!

You can WP:Cite album liner notes even if you don't scan them.

 Pwn leetspeak? (I don't believe so)

There seems to be some fundamental misunderstanding of what leet-speak is in both these articles. The two should not be confused apart from that there are some crossover usage because most hackers/crackers are also gamers. Consequently, references to """"pwn"""" and other Internet slang terms should not be in the main body of this article as they are not leet or leet-speak.

 flaw 

Pesky, I love analogies, problem is, they are always tough, to make good ones. (For example, the rising water was threatening to do the Man of Faith in, and it only defeated him, after he stupidly refused aid. Problem is, the rising water, representing a future threat, giving time to make correct decision to accept aid, is passe in this case. The water has already drowned the Man of Faith, before the story begins. The block/threat/damage/drowning, has already taken place, it is not a future threat. Ask yourself if there is a future threat on Peny now that is worse than his present situation. They already """"got him"""", he feels unjustly so, without policy basis. He's been roasted already, and in heaven already. The story was cute, but the analogy is broken.)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Abu Huraira is one of the most prolific muhaddithin and a source of many of the sahih hadith.

I don't know whether the Opus Dei adheres to the index or, as it is said, censures new books, but I may say that if, it wouldn't be to blame for it. It has every right over its membership and followers, until forbidden so by the Holy See, that the Holy See itself over all the Church had when it did publish the index.
Though this has been officially denied, I believe the action of H. Em. Bertone against the Da Vinci Code was not far from censuring, and a quite just censuring too according to what one hears about its content (I actually didn't read it, Michael Crichton is better).
That Nietzsche was not included (I'm not sure about Schopenhauer) has I believe the easy reason that there was no need of clarification that his works are non-Catholic, and so """"on the index"""" by general rule without any need of explicity. Of course theoretically, those books Kant wrote on religion (and that includes the Critic of pure r.) would be implicitly on the index as well because he was not a Catholic, but from the very fact that he did believe in God, the Congregation may have felt the status of his books, from the Catholic point of view, needed further clarification. Also, not every work of Kant was listed.
As to its importance as of now, I agree (as a layman and non-theologian) that reading some of the books today not only does not lead to ecclesiastic penalties (as should be sure) but also is not sinful in itself, as no longer any disobedience to Church law (likewise, of course, as to Card. Bertone's semi-censuring) but it may be dangerous and thus imprudent, which can be not free from sin. (?) 84.154.109.57

 Re - Silent Films 

By some virtue, I've been addressing errors in the historical record and submitting corrections to different venues for all matter of silent film works. I am liking how later productions by most companies have plenty of images and background works to go by. As long as errors like this exist, I'll have to be on my toes.

TO: KMH03 AND MARK

I am not slipping.  I have taken responsibility for my actions said I should not have created the bio of duncharris.  I shouldn't have done this.  Two wrongs do not make a right.

I also realize that mark is right I should use the term non-BSF.  

Thirdly, I am very aware via the creationism article that it is the minority view people who are not respected.  Are they given a chance to present info or is the article overrun by the consensus contrary to the minority view article policy?  I think we know the answer to this question.  But Wikipedia doesn't really care about respecting minority view articles in many cases.  Now I realize that some want to take a cookie cutter approach and let the consensus view dominate, overrun and even trample minority view articles.  This is not Wikipedia policy though.  

Now you can say I am unreasonable but it is simply not true.  

Now I saw Mark's """"assuming that Wikipedia doesn't work"""" comment.  I do think it is fair to ask if the creationism article is working.  Is it working?  Is there much civility like some (not many) internet creation-evolution forums I have seen?  No there isn't civility. It is a failure.  I believe Wikipedia fails in issues like creationism.   I think it is a failure due to mismanagement or due to premeditation.   But I believe it is a failure.  I know it is not blasphemy to say Wikipedia fails in issues like this.  Minority view people are often not respected at Wikipedia even in minority view articles.  

Now why was the Conservative Christianity repeatedly changed to Christian right?  Is it because of magnaninimous generosity of a person in the non-BSF camp? No it wasn't.   

Perhaps in the future articles like creationism will have the minority view truly aired and done in accordance with the current Wikipedia rules.  But I think this is unrealistic at this time as I see no commitment at this time.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Masada2000 has the distinction, by the way, of being the top result for a Google search of self-hating jew; I never meant to diminish the importance of non-Kahanist sites that provide lists of self-hating Jews, if there are any.
Did you look, by the way, at the article that you have jumped to the defense of? Or did you just go by what Jayjg managed to convince you of? It really is a sad and pathetic article, Radiant, and it maybe serves to remind that not even the Jews can leave the Jews alone.

Wikipedia (it's editors and administrators) uses double standards and does not follow their own written polices as they have wrongly and recklessly deleted the following addition to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl wikipedia article. 

 Independent film maker Royce Mathew had sued the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer Inc./films, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio in Federal Court in regards to the Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  Detailed in the lawsuits www.disneylawsuit.com  filed in Federal court “PUBLIC RECORD” (2005 & 2006), and in various national and international news and press releases, state that in the early 1990's independent film maker Royce Mathew had pitched his original supernatural pirate story to the Walt Disney Company which is about “cursed pirates” of the Black Pearl pirate ship; pirates who don't want anything to do with the plunder/return a treasure because they are cursed, with effects of the curse they endure is fully revealed by moonlight and the gold medallion on a gold chain with mystic properties able to summon/call.  Royce Mathew had made a short derivative video work in 1994.  Royce Mathew’s credits included projects for Paramount Pictures, Allan Carr, David DeCoteau and Charles Band and his Full Moon Entertainment company.

Then years later, as the lawsuit details, via Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the Walt Disney Company, had incorporated various homages from their Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride attraction into Royce Mathew’s supernatural pirate story, and are selling it as Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl movie franchise.   The Walt Disney Company states that Royce Mathew’s claims and lawsuits have no merit.  

During legal proceedings,  the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer (films/Inc.), Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio “The Defendants” were all represented by the same team of attorneys headed by Sanford “Sandy” Litvack, who is a close associate of the Walt Disney Company (Michael Eisner), who also was the Walt Disney Company’s attorney in the noted lawsuit of Jeffrey Katzenberg vs the Walt Disney Company.",0,0,0,0,0,0

In the case of a rape victim, the family can reveal the name and the family of Nirbhaya did. However the juvenile isn't allowed ti be named under Juvenile Justice Act. Additionally the victimisation and probable threat on his life if his name is revealed also makes another case why his name shouldn't be there whether the name the sources gave might be wrong or true.

I would argue however that """"incidence"""", which relates to new appearances of DID in the community at large, isn't a good subheading because the section includes a discussion of both incidence and prevalence.  I suggest using a subheading with both (==Incidence and prevalence==) though another option is simply leaving it as epidemiology.  The WP:MEDMOS#Diseases or disorders or syndromes doesn't give much guiance here bar noting that ==Epidemiology== should include incidence and prevalence information; no mention of subsections.  Usually you leave it as a single larger section until it gets sufficiently lengthy that it makes sense to split them out (which is itself dependent on the sources).  I've replaced the section heading (but both I and P).  The section overall needs fleshing out with more sources, which I think are unfortunately lacking.

ff7f3e14fe0ae328,"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden, and engaging in misrepresentation in using an arbitrator's view on a separate matter to be absolute on all matters. It contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.   

The assumption of bad faith is on your part, for you clearly have not read - NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority.

 My signature and your actions ~  

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  

You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  

 Why it wasn't a personal attack 
""""The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has 

""""A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""

And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".
In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  

Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  

So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  

As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, 

""""Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""

In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed.

 What could have happened 
So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  

What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  

If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

Adult Film Career Revision Proposal

This paragraph needs editing.  It has several problems

 Moving to Germany had nothing to do with Adult films.
 This sentence is superflous:  """"Other films included Man to Men and Jawbreaker.""""
 This sentence seems to be selling the films or gratuitously promoting them. """"Scenes from some films have been re-released as part of compilations which is common in the porn industry. The compilation Touched by an Anal was released in 1997; a more recent release was in 2006, Mansex Meltdown.""""
 This sentence has nothing to do with the Adult Film Career heading: """"Though he has appeared in gay and bisexual porn films, Sanchez identifies as heterosexual and has stated that he has had no homosexual contact since joining the Corps in 2003.""""

Re-write for Adult Career 2.0

So, we could re-write:

In the early 1990's, Matt Sanchez lived in Montreal, Canada where he worked in the adult entertainment industry in all-male films for prominent directors John Rutherford and Kristen Bjorn and Chi Chi Larue at the studios Bijou, Catalina and Falcon Video.  For French-speaking films, he used the stage name Pierre LaBranche, but all of his titles in the United States were under Rod Majors.   

During his career, Sanchez stared in several award-winning adult films including Call of the Wild, Jawbreaker and Idol Country co-starring Ryan Idol and Marco Rossi. 

Scenes from many films have recently been re-released as part of compilations; Sanchez stated in an interview with Radar Magazine that it """"was just the nature of the business, you shoot a lot of films and they use them forever."""" Sanchez later wrote, """"In porn, everything taboo is trivialized and everything trivial is magnified.""""

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

You can continue vandalizing this page, but your vandalism will be under surveillance and will not last long. All you have shown so far is that you are skilled in utilizing strawman arguments but creating misleading fallacies and lies will not go too far. Several editors have participated on creation and maintenance of this article and even though controversies over images as well as text occurred, we have been able to reach consensus on most matters. In this particular case - I am willing and open to accept the consensus again. If the majority vote selects your snapshot, I will go with it. But I will not just because you set up a strawman to mislead everyone with lies.

Trust me, your message is clear and we get it. You are going to attack others to get your point across no matter what. You are not afraid to wield unfounded mockery (poor photography = lmao) because the picture you are trying to force upon this page has absolutely nothing to offer, so you can't point anyone to anything worthy about it.

 All this argument crap. 

In my opinion, 
a) Notability is established in this article in the fact that One Bid is a qualifying game played 6 times a show, every show, 5 days a week, on a highly rated network game show, and has been an element of every version of the show since the original. It would be ideal to have some other citations to show it's been recognized outside of the show itself, but I believe sufficient notability has been met, and the tag needn't be there.

b) Original research. If you are read the tag, it says """"See talk page for details."""" If you are not going to either tag with  or start a talk page section explaining what you believe is original research (or be more specific by tagging only the relevant sections), then I don't believe the tag should stand

c) I think this article does need more citations. I think almost every article on wikipedia needs more citations than are currently there. However, since there isn't even a single  tag on the article, I don't see what specific information is felt to be requiring citation. As I understand it, Wikipedia practice allows primary sources (in this case, the show itself) to act as a source for anything relevant to rules and how the game is played and what happens. So if there are major uncorroborated facts in the article, you ought to tag them specifically to justify a refimprove banner tag

d) The merge discussion seems to have been abandonned. I believe it should be appropriately revived and an actual pro/con vote be taken, or else abandon the merge tag. I see no evidence of support from the discussion linked to in the tag.

This is my opinion as to how the tags should be dealt with. It is not sufficient to just say """"original research exists in this article so I'm going to slap a tag at the top."""" (for example). These tags should be supported by specific explainations or pointers to actual problematic content unless the entire article really needs citing or is original research, which I don't find to be the case here.

Gold Dragon his account was deleted because he had more then on account name. untail I can contact the woman from Wikidoc to answear my question.

Zeus freeing the Cyclopes from Hades. That being said you also told me you read Theoi. So do I. I have read everything on Theoi. It's source of information. My question is how to you edit information. Do you copy off of other Wikipedia pages. I ask this because I read false information on Wikipedia before. Most of the time information is correct but I have seen. False information put on there before. Which is why I never trust what I read on Wikipedia. It's good I can Talk to you. To get to know you a little better. I would like to know do you use published sources. Do you read a lot of greek mythology books. Where does your knowlege come from. I'm trying to make sure that you didnt just copy what you put in. off another Wikipedia article. Or a website that copy's off of Wikipedia. Any information will help me out. I am a greek mythology nut case. I like the greek god Hades a lot. Which is why I am asking this question. The reason why I got concerned about the whole topic. Was I read what look like the source on the Cyclopes page. After I read the play it was not anywhere on there. I later found out that I mis understood what. Gold Dragon said. I got mad about it. Because I dont trust Wikipedia. Right now Wikipedia is the only source I can find that says. Zeus returned the Cyclopes from Hades. After their death. So what I am asking is what kind of sources do you use on everything. I hope dont just repeat stuff from unreilable sources. Do you use published sources. One's that can be trusted.

But then when I come to post that, I happen to glance at the jumble of a signature there and see that the """"Guy"""" who was posting on my talk page was the same as the """"JzG"""" who appears in my block log.

So then the question becomes, why the third-person passive-voice nonsense?  What's this """"Right now you have a block of 7 days"""" stuff, as if you are informing me of someone else's actions?  You blocked me.  Just say soespecially if you are going to twiddle with your user name so that what I see in the notice is something different from what I see in my block log.  I almost mistook you for some well-intentioned soul who thought that he was going to offer to help out in some unspecified way in my reeducation.  Some helpful, innocent bystander with a """"Help!"""" button in his signature for some reason or anther.

To say that one cannot raise an issue and claim, on a forum for making such complaints about the actions of editors such as WP:ANI, that an editor's actions have been rude and inconsiderate (or even aggressive, your word, if I had said that), is ludicrous.  It is totally contrary to all sense of fairness and due process, on Wikipedia or anywhere else. Raising such an issue is clearly not a violation of WP:CIVIL, whether or not in your subjective opinion  you can find some excuse for that actionbut you haven't even bothered to try to do that.

But you also seem to have entirely missed the point of the issue I raised at WP:ANI.  Rlevse's actions in disrupting the process are not wrong becasue he was incidentally rude and inconsiderate to me in doing so; they are wrong because they are bad for Wikipedia.  They are wrong because they corrupt the process of the various dispute resolution network we have.  They would have been wrong if he had been pleasant and nice to me and had tried to discuss things with me and actually accomplish something, rather than blocking me out of the blue.  The fact that he was rude and inconsiderate is irrelevant to that issue.  I even pointed that out there, and don't understand how you could have missed that.

You are instead assuming bad faith on my part, in addition to not paying any attention to the actual issues raised there.  You have turned a blind eye to the issue that was raised, just because, for whatever reasonand I don't have a clue what it isyou have taken a dislike to me. Not a good foundation for any discussion.

But then, you aren't really interested in discussion, are you?  No more so than Rlevse.  No, in fact, much less sohe didn't block me to keep me from responding to anything he had said. He merely didn't say anything, anywhere. You, OTOH, have blocked me specifically to stop me from addressing your response or anyone else's on the WP:ANI discussion, and the subsequent one on WP:AN.

The disruption of WQA was done to give an advantage in content disputes to User:Greg L, who had already had a Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts on his own actions at Kilogram, filed by User:Enuja in [this back on 1 September, before I ever got involved in that discussion there.  The issues raised then have continued almost unabated or even in a worsening manner, with a changing cast of characters other than the constant Greg L involvement, and remain largely unresolved.

 Fred Meyer: Reversion 

I was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the Fred Meyer article. That addition was composed of four parts. 
First, you claimed Fred G. Meyer to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order etc., providing sources. I won't discuss the validity of the sources here, but that clearly concerns Fred G. Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. 
Next, you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to Hitler. As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. 
Thirdly, you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed """"U-Boats"""", but this, the part most relevant for the stores, was still unsourced. 
Finally, the """"Notes"""" part could have been more fitting for the talk page, but definitely does not belong into the article proper.
Thus, your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced.

My argument was this, the website that you posted was full of ideas and links that are one sided. Thus, even if the claims are true, the website can not be used to source ideas because of this one sided bias. I have sourced why i think the website was one sided.

Stop calling people """"nationalists"""". It is offensive and a waste of time. According to the modern psychiatry and the police detectives interrogation techniques, you are the ones that are nationalistic and one sided because of self-projection psychological projection.

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight.

 Cleanup 

The constant edit-warring on this short little article has got to stop, so I'd like to bring up the edits by  in the hope of generating some discussion and reaching a long-overdue consensus.

1. The first sentence says tomoi is the result of """"Siamese influence in the area"""" and provides two references. However, this is not in the given citations. These references deal with the history of the Thai community in Kedah, but make no mention of tomoi or kickboxing. Am I wrong?

2. The word tomoi is usually said to be a cognate of dhoi muay rather than a derivative term. Anyone fluent in both Malay and Thai will be aware of the many cognates such as the words for """"lizard"""", """"door"""", """"key"""", and the numerous Sanskrit-derived terms. Muay or moi comes from the Sanskrit mavya, therefore it would be incorrect to say that one derives from the other. They are similar because they come from the same source and because the two countries are neighbours.

3. I wrote in the article that tomoi in the Malay language refers to the local style of kickboxing while tinju is the generic word for any boxing art, particularly the western kind. I sourced a dictionary for this sentence. Yet the sentence has been edited and now defines tomoi as the """"sport of Siamese Kedah"""", while still retaining the given source. In other words, it's not in the citation given, once again.

4. Why is so much emphasis given to Kedah when the art is most often associated with Kelantan? This is consistent with the sources provided since all of them mention Kelantan. A major reason why the sport is not so well-known today is because it was banned in Kelantan where it was most popular. The state government even planned to rename tomoi """"Kelantan boxing"""". Yes it is practiced in Kedah and other states as well, but to state conclusively that tomoi comes from Kedah is simply not supported by any source or even general public opinion.

5. The first few sentences of the history section are atrociously-written and repeat some of the same material which I had already written in and sourced.

6. Language like """"it is a clear fact"""" seems pointy.

7. The first paragraph of the history section does not deal with tomoi or any martial art. Why does it matter how many temples are in Kedah? What does the dominant religion or language of the state have to do with anything? The same two references are provided for the paragraph once again, and neither are relevant to the article. But the sourced paragraph is followed by the sentence """"The art of """"Tomoi"""" or """"ToiMauy""""(ต่อยมวย) were teach and practice among these Siamese communities in Kedah and Kelantan"""" which is unsourced and entirely POV.

8. The origin of Indochinese kickboxing is a disputed topic. Authors like Draeger mention Chinese and Indian influence on muay Thai, which can logically be extended to tomoi, pradal serey, etc. But then there are those (unreliable) sources which claim bokator as the common ancestor. I thought it fair to say that their origin is unclear. Yet the article states very conclusively that tomoi is of Siamese origin and goes on to mention the regional styles of muay boran. Silat Embo (the precursor of tomoi) and Siku 12 (a related style) are not mentioned.

9. """"It is also a clear fact that the system of Tomoi, be the guard,stance,and striking techniques, is identical to Muay Thai."""" This is actually true. And putting aside any modern political boundaries, tomoi is the same as muay Thai and Muay Lao. I can say this from personal experience. However, that doesn't necessarily mean tomoi came from muay Thai. As mentioned before, they may all have their origins in Cambodia or somewhere else.

10. The history section continues by saying that boxers originally wrapped their hands in hemp ropes, and provides an irelevant source which only deals with muay Thai in Thailand. The editor then goes on to say that these hand-wraps did not exist prior to Ayutthaya. First of all, boxers fought bare-fisted before the custom of wrapping the hands. And more importantly, sources like Draeger say the date at which boxers first began wrapping their hands """"cannot be known with certainty"""". And even if the practice does not predate Ayutthaya, that doesn't mean it comes from Ayutthaya. And even if it does, that doesn't mean tomoi comes from Thailand. That's quite a stretch.

How do you not understand that you're confirming that the Babylonian empire ended in 539 when its king was called to account?!!  
Strawman. Try again  talk 

Read Jeremiah 25:12. It gives an order of events. 1) 70 years ends. 2) Babylon's king is called to account. Babylon's king was called to account in 539. Ergo, 70 years ended in 539. Ergo, 70 years of nations serving Babylon began in 609. Babylon replaced the Assyrian world power in 609.  
As I keep telling you, your exegesis is fatuous for it obviates the context of 2 Chronicles 36:20,21; Jeremiah 25:12; Zechariah 1:12; Daniel 9:2; Zechariah 7:5 and Jeremiah 29:10, among others. Try again.  talk 

 Fringe Views? 

Please desist from changing articles to match the fringe views of Jehovah's Witnesses. You might like to start a section at articles' Talk pages, however it is unlikely that you will be able to indicate any widespread support for the alternative views taught by your religion. Thanks.  

How is it fringe when they're based on accurate and reliable sources? Wikipedia is a place for truth not your noetical bigotry.   
Reliable sources indicate the widely accepted chronology of the period. They do not support the JW chronology. And you didn't even provide any sources. You will need to discuss at the article's Talk pages to reach a concensus, however there are no mainstream sources in support of your views.  

Agreed. I've reverted you again.   
You are both misinformed. According to the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus conquered Babylon in October 539 B.C.E. Cyrus’ first regal year began in the spring of 538 B.C.E. This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E. or “the seventh month (Tishri)” as Ezra 3:1 says.

It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalem’s destruction. Dates other than 607 BCE ignore the statements in Scripture that the land would be desolate for 70 years. (Daniel 9:1,2)    

Looking at your other edits I'm concerned that you don't have any grasp yet of WP:NPOV. I've raised them at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bible#Editor changes biblical dates, etc where I hope you will explain your edits. You are also failing to use WP:Edit summaries, which is sufficient reason for many people to revert you.   

Thank you for the reminder concerning the """"edit summaries"""" field.   

You said: This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E.. That is wrong. The JW conclusion that the Jews 'must' have returned the following year is entirely speculative. Josephus explicitly states that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus second year, which means the Jews were back in his first year, which means Cyrus decree was made at the beginning of hist first year, and the Jews then had 6 months to make the 4-month journey back to Jerusalem.

On this point I was wondering whether there's a danger of over emphasising the parties in this election. Although it makes sense for other elections it's clear that independent candidates are going to do unusually well (although I don't know if any will win) because of the specific nature of the posts being elected. I wonder if there is a way to highlight the independent vote (which will likely  outstrip Lib Dem and UKIP's vote nationally.

Personally, I am shocked that this sort of statement would ever be appropriate for a Wikipedia article Talk page and if ever there was an appropriate moment for it to be statement would be for the private grievance process that any organization of value would recognize and have previously established if a need have developed. Anyone that would feel comfortable dealing in this particular way I would hope would realize their misjudgment. This type od action poisons minds and unsettles people that are in a setting that is of a making not of their own. Now as for what you said: """"I notice you're not interested in the substance here. Your personal attacks are out of order."""" Why on earth would anyone say such a conceited and probably self-serving statement especially when that seems to be in reply to someone cautioning you about what you say of others who replied to your reasoning of an issue and were not swayed. Not only that but that YOU felt compelled not to rest your argument for an issue on your own efforts but to bring in others to whom YOU showed their work and seemed more than happy to return an unfavorable review.

If I were charged with building support for an issue and wanted that effort thought on the reasons I presented then I certainly would not say that your work is no good because others have told me. What makes you think that what others not in the process of that deliberation trump the work of others? Was this brought on because someone was so forthcoming in an attempt to check your ulterior motives with the statement: """"Any nullification sourcing from you provides much more indication of what value it holds."""" Especially when that same person says, """"I am not here to actively make enemies and disrupt others. All I can say is that I reiterate my statement and that to yours, """"Take on a world with no problems, you take on problems and stand alone.""""

You are a trouble maker! And probably a sour sport. If any one is not interested in the efforts of Wikipedia is would appear just by your effort in this one section by itself. You can cry wolf only so many times before irritation precedes you. You just may have shown your true colors.

My reason for suggesting this is that 247 MPs voted to forcibly retire Dyer from duty with only 37 MPs voting to keep him.  Later, a Dyer supporter (Carson) attempted to pass a motion of mild approval of Dyer, but was defeated 230 MPs (against approval), 129 MPs (pro-mild approval).  This suggests that a majority of MPs was against Dyer.  All this is covered in the reference 4.

Hi again   I really think the solar sail people are a bit optimistic about its use for interstellar travel.  The reason is just that as the acceleration is slow, you have to wait a long time, and travel a long way, to reach high speed.  At a uniform acceleration a, you reach velocity v after traveling a distance s according to 

 v = sqrt(2as)

in Newtonian approximation, which is applicable at the speeds we could hope to reach.  Then

 s = v2/(2a)

and for a given v, s gets very large if a is small.  But since the intensity of sunlight decreases like 1/s2 with distance from the Sun, a does not remain constant, but drops rapidly, making things very much worse.  Once you get out to well beyond the orbit of Pluto, where the Sun begins to look like a very bright star, the photon drag of the light of other stars begins to become significant, as well as the cosmic background radiation, which has an energy density comparable to that of starlight.  Finally there is the problem that at really high speeds, the light of the Sun would begin to be red shifted, so you lose power from that effect too.  Some of these problems can be solved by beaming light or microwaves out to the ship, with a huge power station (a trillion watts, say) near the Earth, and a large aperture mirror to focus the beam on the ship.  Then, as long as you can maintain the focal spot as small as the ship's sail, you could get constant acceleration.  A calculation I did years ago (which I will not try to reproduce now...) suggested to me that speeds of maybe  0.1c could conceivably be reached in this manner (which is very exciting) — but then, somehow, you have to stop.  

(For example, if I recall, if the aperture of the beaming mirror is R, the ship sail dia r, the distance from the Sun D, and the wavelength λ, then you need 

 λ/R = r/D

and acceleration 10-3g will get you to 0.03c in 30 years, at a distance D of 0.5 light years, 1018/2 cm, which makes the mirror R ~ 50 km in diameter for a sail r 100 km, with a 1 um λ.  NB the mirror needs to be optically perfect to << λ, but the sail does not.)

Of course 0.1c is a useful speed, and you might split the problem between a beamed laser sailer, with a fusion rocket to stop, but the trillion watt figure I remember was for a fairly small ship, 100 or 1000 tons if I recall, and I think a nuclear-electric ship capable of reaching even a few percent of c is going to be much larger than that for a payload of 100 or 1000 tons.  I cannot imagine a decade ship smaller than an aircraft carrier, so it sounds like a pretty tough way to go, though possibly competitive with other approaches.  

What I personally think we need to do is work the problem modestly hard from an engineering standpoint, considering all approaches, producing realistic design mission studies that give us the best trade-off solution with current technology.  Right now the trip time, for a program we could realistically sell to the combined economies of the planet, would probably last a thousand years or more.  So in ten or thirty years we should redo the study, and see how that number has changed due to technological advances.  At some point the curve of reasonable trip times will either get down to the order of the time between studies, or else it will flatten out when we hit the wall of feasible engineering.  Or maybe there will be a huge breakthrough when somebody figures out how to create a wormhole to a nearby star, or something equally revolutionary.  Anyhow, only when the trip time is getting down to the time between studies (which would depend on the rate of technology change) would it be sensible to start a serious program, with what NASA would call a """"Phase A study"""", leading to a program start, then a Preliminary Design Review, and then a Critical Design Review,... which is when you can start cutting metal. 

Solar sailing is probably a competitive way of getting around the Solar System, though I think nuclear-electric ion drives are likely to prove better.  The latter can certainly take us all over the Solar System in the time scales of the great explorations of the 15th and 16th centuries.  Then in 500 years the Solar System will be ours, and we will have a far better idea of exactly what is out there in the dark between the stars, possibly mini-solar systems like Jupiter & its moons.  If such systems are common, we might find useful places to go only 1% as far as Alpha Centauri, which would change everything.  And the human species would be safe at last from the many disasters which threaten us now.

Er, no. Nice try (I'm being kind) but do you really believe that portraying a £720,000 EU grant for researching new ways of thickening several food products, including yoghurt, as """"£700,000 to stop yoghurt going runny"""" is as much of a misrepresentation as the way you mischaracterised Britain's 1939 declaration of war? No, of course you don't. Frankly, I find it hard to believe that anyone can think of the yoghurt thing (and many other examples) as being any kind of misrepresentation, but the Commission certainly does, else such stories wouldn't be on its many lists of """"myths"""", so I have to assume that you and other Wikipedians are being sincere when you see misrepresentation where I see only (justifiable) disrespect and ingratitude.

So let's start from the bottomthe top. The current article starts with a lot of tosh about urban legendsby stating that """"Euromyths can be either wholly untrue or a deliberate distortion of the facts"""". Truth is unwelcome, as is accidental or ignorant distortion. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, a Euromyth is always a deliberate calumny.

Now, that's certainly the way the word is used by a very large number of people. Trouble is, though, that this very large number of people is ignorant of the facts - the facts as presented by the arch-priests of this very large number of people, to wit the European Commission and its many propaganda outlets. To put it simply, any examination of any official list of Euromyths will throw up at least one Euromyth that is to myth, falsehood and misrepresentation what Plan D was to  democarcy, dialogue and debatenot mythical at all.

So the article is wrong to start as it does. Once you have conceded that, and all this tedious """"urban legend"""" ping-pong has been banished, we can get on with sorting out the rest of it. (I currently see five categories ...)

It was just the two of us hanging out [during the last days] she was very funny. We didn’t have to [talk] because I always knew how she felt about me, I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn’t have to have these heart to heart talks.""""

Oh well done. I'm such a bad boy for """"attacking"""" the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""". Jesus Christ. All I wanted to know was why the Trayvon Martin case is not on the front page, and now I know - the people making the decisions about such things are just talking utter crap, and people like you who are apparently so threatened by the prospect of the outside world finding this out, you're prepared to shut me up, forcibly (and more despicably, others then remove my comments as if they had never been made at all). Well done.

And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising """"most right and proper good humor"""" in acting that way. And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a """"Rambling Man"""". Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground. It only remains to be seen what the name """"Bishonen"""" means, but I doubt it's anything remotely intellectual, probaby just a cartoon reference or something. You can block me for 48 hours, but on this evidence, Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life. On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).""",1,0,0,0,0,0

My evening with a Drag queen

Rama Rau

I am meeting Enza Supermodel for a TV show. It's 5.45 pm and I wait
at my friend's office on Queen Street in downtown Toronto. After
waiting a while, my friend tells me: ``I don't know if she's gonna
come in her male persona or her female one. ``Ummm hmmm, I reply.
I'm mildly curious about meeting a Drag Queen myself, having thus far
only seen them on the subway or in downtown clubs.

I try recollecting what little I knew about Enza. Her real name: Enzo
Anderson. In 2000, she ran for mayor of Toronto, Ontario. Although
the eventual winner of that campaign, Mel Lastman, won over 80 per
cent of the vote, Anderson surprised many by garnering 15,000 votes,
placing third! She was one of the few candidates (besides Lastman,
Ben Kerr and Tooker Gomberg) to get any kind of recognition in the
race, even though all she did was stand on downtown street corners
with a handmade placard that read: """"Vote for me - I have the best
legs in town.""""

Having changed her name to """"Enza Supermodel"""", Anderson (whose sense
of irony, I learn later, is razor-sharp), runs in political races
where the major candidate has no serious challenger on the ballot.

At 6.15, fashionably late, she walks in, six feet, three inches tall,
in her beautiful black pointy stilettos; she's wearing a short black
dress, showing off great legs, light black stockings and a chic black
leather jacket. And the first thing I think is - Oh. My. God.

She is beautiful. That particular day I'm wearing scruffy blue jeans
cut-off at the knees, running shoes and a T-shirt I grabbed from my
closet two minutes before I ran out the door. Some lipstick, a dash
of mascara and I was ready in seconds. Now, looking at her, I feel
less like a woman than I've ever felt in my entire life. I never was
one of those `la de da' women, mind you, but right now, I wish I was.
I feel insecure, ugly and yes, jealous.

We get into a taxi and Enza graciously lets me sit in the front seat.
I feel a bit awkward. I don't know where to start, so I stare out the
window. I look back politely and smile now and then as Enza talks to
my friend. Suddenly she says, """"Oh, lovely nails!"""" and I jump. Er ah,
my nails? But she is charming about it.

After that, we settle down to some nice comfortable girl talk and I
ask her the question I've been dying to ask. """"How long does it take
you to do your make-up, Enza?"""" and she replies, """"Three hours."""" After
all, she has to do her legs, her arms, her face, her body. She's
happy to give me the most minute (and unnecessary) details of how she
wanted a breast job but decided to just wear padded bras instead.

That evening, the TV show meeting turns out to be a disaster. The
three men in the room (all heterosexuals, they assure each other)
can't take their eyes of Enza's legs. I get a lot of amusement
watching how their eyes slide down her legs and desperately make an
attempt to meet yours if you address them. She is charming and funny.
She tells the crowd how she got her name, """"Ya know, gurrl friend,
what else would I be, but a Supah model?"""" and how she works in a bar
during the day and takes photographs of celebrities by night.

I must admit I'm fascinated. Enza studied to be an engineer and later
began dressing up in drag, partly to party, and partly because that's
her version of Show Biz.

""""Honey, I put on a good show, I got more shoes and dresses than
Imelda Marcos!"""" I believe that.

I go home that evening, feeling a little strange inside my head. It's
the first time I've felt special to be born a woman. And to think I
had to meet a Drag Queen to make me feel this way.

Also, Jones never accused David Mayer de Rothschild personally of being the head of a neo-feudal empire, he did however infer that his family was involved with such.  Rothschild repeatedly accused Jones of being an oil baron, which is absurd and ironic considering the Rothschild investments in big oil.  Anyway, if we're to believe David de Rothschild's book, then the solution to global warming is to wear sweaters, ride in electric geo metros packed like clown cars, and build straw houses.  If anyone can show me a Rothschild (of the actual European banking line) that doesn't live in a castle and instead lives in a straw house, I will actually waste money on this chap's silly, insulting book.  I wonder how many beautiful trees are now dead because David de Rothschild wanted to publish this book.  As for Rothschild's demeanor, of course he was somewhat calm, it's part of the training.  The best liars are always calm because they have gone to schools where that selling point technique is taught.  It's called public relations, and it only works on dullards in my opinion.

While some skeptics of Global Warming declare that Global Warming is a hoax in its entirety, some who admit that the global temperature is rising argue that it is not attributable to man, and that it is a natural phenomenon.  One argument for this theory is that a simultaneous phenomenon is happening on the planet Mars, Mars Hints at Solar, not Human, Cause for Warming, Scientists Say, by Kate Ravilious, 2/28/07, National Geographic via nationalgeographic.com.  which suggests that Global Warming may not be limited to the only planet where human interaction could have influence.
In addition, while Venus is the token example of an Earth-like planet globally warmed by excessive C02 in the atmosphere, there is no man-made industrialism or other sources of greenhouse emissions present on Venus.

Agreed. I amended the article after the chessbase article came out. I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat. Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, """"Topalov was accused of cheating"""" and """"Topalov cheated"""", so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use.

Later, of course, the Turks conveniently took the role of the great enemies of Iran.  The extent of the influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own history as well as that of Iran.  The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the Qarakhanid dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the 'family of Afrasiyab' and so it is known in the Islamic history”(R.N.

Comment
Can someone please tell me why this list has many sit-down restaurants in it, like Big Boy? Also, should we really include fast-casual restaurants in this list as well? Dec '06

 Wrong countries 
TelePizza is not Polish. It's Spanish. Poland is dominated by McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut... etc and sadly didn't develop even one national chain to compete with them!

I'm not sure if it's some kind of """"pro-Canadianism"""" or what, but many companies founded in the U.S. are listed erroneously under Canada instead of where they belong, either in International or U.S.

I fixed a few but I'm sure there are lots others if someone wants to help out.
 

 Agreed, I'm fixing a few today...  

On a similar note, I am currently moving some from United States to International, where the business in question also operates in Australia.   

 Pizza 

A pizza place that customizes, to order, every order they take, and take 20 minutes to make are NOT fast food restaurants.  Sorry, but no way.  Who is writing this list?  TGIFridays?  Fuddruckers?  Have any of the writers here ever EATEN at these places?  Also, there should be zero overlap between fast-casual and fast food.  There is a noteable difference.  I'm tempted to delete all the fast-casuals that I recognize out of this list, but I'll wait to see what others think.  

 Where? 

Where does Long John Silver's go to? it should be added to the list.  

 Grouping 
Some places listed in International should not be listed in Coutries. I've removed McDonald's from  Eqypt, India, Mexico, and USA, since they are ALL franchised off of McDonald's International. I left McDonalds Canada since it seems to have it's own President and logos etc (with the Maple Leaf).  Also, I've removed other """"international"""" items like KFC, Pizza Hut, etc from international places.  Also, Dunkin' Donuts, and Krispy Kreme are NOT fast food.  They are donut stores, with sandwhiches added in the last few years.  A suggestion, so as to not have 'doubles' and not need to have them in the founded country, is, have a flag beside the international resturant where it was founded.  I.E. McDonald's would have a US Flag, * Made In Japan Teriyaki Experience Would have a Canadian flag etc.  

 Russian fast food chart looks short 
There are more interesting fast food chaines started from Russia. Such as Pasta La Vista italian cuisine cafe. Check www.pasta-la-vista.com or http://i-food.livejournal.com/
It offers pizza in a cone among other specialties...

 US/International List 

Wendy's is listed under the Internatioanl Fastfood chains, but its not listed under the US Fastfood chains. Is this an error, or is there a particular reason for this?
Anitha
8/7/07

This is also true for Pizza Hut, while many other chains are listed under both. Is this just a miss, or was there a reason?

 Is there a list for out of business ones? 

I added Red Steer. I think they're out of business. They launched a kids meal in a box around about the same time McDonalds started their Happy Meal. They also had small burgers called Lil Pardners. Same size as White Castle or Krystal Burger. Their thing was the beef they used came from some breed of cattle with red hair and a white face.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 Removed unnecessary UK fast food outlets 

Seriously, there is no need to list every single Halal chicken restaurant you have ever seen in the UK. It is unnecessary to have such a long list of non-chain stores. Goes against the guidelines too. Also got rid of restaurants that are not fast food, such as Frankie and Bennys.

e7f26385dd04567a,"WP:MOSMED is the Manual of Style for articles that come under any of the Medical categories. All medical-related articles have to comply to reach Good Article (GA) or above (hehe - I only found out about it at the second GA Review!).
Try typing 'Paul Bert' into the search box in the left column of any page and click the 'Search' button (rather than pressing Enter or clicking the Go button). You'll get the search results - the article Paul Bert is first, and Oxygen toxicity is fourth. If you click the Go button instead, you go direct to the article if it exists, otherwise you get the search results as before. Try the same test searching for 'Paul Bert effect'.
There is an article on Decompression sickness - we plan to tackle that after we have finished getting Nitrogen narcosis to GA. No need to mention those in Oxygen toxicity - although all of them are summarised in Scuba diving#Effects_of_breathing_high_pressure_gas.
The partial pressure of oxygen is the trigger for OxTox: that is found by multiplying the fraction of oxygen by the ambient pressure at the depth you're at. For example, air is 21% oxygen and the pressure at 50 metres is 6 bar. So you have a partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) of 0.21 x 6 = 1.26 bar. That's safe from CNS OxTox as it's never been observed at less than 1.3 bar. Divers may use gas mixtures different from air, however - take a look at Nitrox for more information.
It's my pleasure to try to explain where I can. I must admit it was a little mischievous of me to throw you in at the deep end on Oxygen toxicity . But believe me, the discipline needed to meet all the style requirements is a great learning experience and worth the effort. By the way, hyperoxia is linked - but to its dictionary definition in Wiktionary like this: wikt:hyperoxia with a pipe (|) to give this: hyperoxia. Let me know if there's any of that you didn't understand. Cheers",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Rory Delap 

Firstly, welcome to Wikipedia. As I say above, if you plan to stay please consider registering.

With regard to Delap, I have a few comments:
The period when he was on loan to Stoke City in 2006 is kept separate in the infobox; thus, when comparing his stats in the infobox, the two appearances during the loan spell need to be discounted.
Generally when counting appearances, most users refer to an independent database such as Soccerbase, rather than the club's website, which is often out of date.
Please do not use your edit summaries to attack other users. One of the tenets of Wikipedia is to assume that the other user is acting under Good Faith; i.e. his/her edits were made after due consideration. Thus comments like; """"if this is causing you confusion"""" and """"learn how to add"""", which are mildly insulting, are not acceptable.

 Why confusion and controversy in the """"real world"""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"the truth"""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"get it wrong"""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.

Instead of """"truth"""", Wikipedia aims for """"verifiability"""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"THE TRUTH"""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.

I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"sweet spot"""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.

 
Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic (and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views). Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV, by removing certain articles from Category:Jesus while adding others to Category:God. I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in Category:Jesus? There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view. Normally, if you make an edit, and someone else reverts it, that means there is no consensus for your edit (and therefore, you shouldn't make it again. Excessively re-adding controversial content is considered edit warring, and you can be blocked for this (see WP:3RR). What you need to do in these situations, is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views. Users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles, that isn't how wikipedia works. I'll also note, that because of our NPOV policy, I see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category Jesus.

That wasn't an attack (ad hominem), that was constructive criticism.  There's a difference.  """"You're an idiot,"""" is an ad hominem attack.  It is a baseless insult with no constructive intention.  """"Rubbish"""" is an ad hominem attack.  There is nothing constructive other than an insult of another contributors work.  Telling fiddle they he or she has an """"arrogant obtuse attitude"""" was constructive with the intention of advice on how to better deal with new posters.  """"Instead of posting rubbish"""" is both an arrogant and insulting statement.  It did nothing to help me create a better article, OR give reasons why the SKK article was being deleted.  """"Rubbish"""" is not an objective criteria.  """"This article has already been posted & debated"""" is.  Of course this fact never was brought up until after the discussion was well out of hand.

Second, you cannot with any intellectual honesty characterize what I posted as """"vandalism.""""  My repeated intention was to make a sincere contribution of a topic that I felt is important.  I was more than happy to discuss the merits of the article as evidenced by my fruitless attempt to use the """"hangon"""" tag.  I literally barely had time to type a few words before the article was again deleted with absolutely zero discussion or valid justification.  

I encourage ALL parties to go back and look at how this played out.  There was NO discussion other than threats & a dismissive suggestion to go play in your own sandbox.  Is this really how you want to run Wiki?  It is, after all, your playground, and you get to make the rules.  That's fine with me.  Maybe you really have dealt with too many vandals, and were quick to lump me in with whatever hooligans you may be used to dealing with.

Second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit.

(Interesting that the Coeur d'Alene article says nothing about this period, maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm) 
From a VERY cursory review of the decision, it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and Idaho's statehood becomes significant in this case, so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact, but it's something that's going to matter.

The way wiki immediately took down the 8 prime spirals pages and the minor referer pages about the person that discovered it way back in 1995 who also has a new project known as HelixQ is a joke.

Let's see the argument of wiki is that the 8 Prime Spirals are not 'peer reviewed', in academia anything involving crypto and national security has been censored for decades and in 1995 when the original paper came out revealing numerous new prime theory that was years ahead of prime theory then, there was no way for such work to even be published, so USENET was how it was distributed, and it's a fact usenet has been heavily edited involving the topic.

Now you can all point to your rules about 'peer review' but this shows how ignorant everyone thus far is about academia and censoring of math involving primes and crypto. Let's see wiki has a page on Dr. Bernstein, a guy that took the NSA to court in 1995 the same year the paper was released, so that's how restricted publishing prime theory as it relates to crypto was in 1995, and is still today.

You expect NSA funded journals like AMS to allow such information to be 'peer reviewed'?

Anyway, my original article was 'heavy handed' killed by 'mods' at wiki and if you don't think the NSA has infiltrated wiki and almost every type of mass social media on the net (and yes to me wiki is a social media/project) then you need to read on the Snowden documents.

So the article put a light on some very interesting 'prime theory' that is supported by GitHub, anyone can check the github cite to see the info that every so-called prime algorithm and many have pages on wiki, all failed to outperform a 2300 year old algorithm, aka sieve of Eratosthenes, all expect for one algorithm, a prime spiral algorithm that I KNOW has been around since 1995 and a theory that has been heavily censored by the NSA since almost any reference to the many posts about ENNISA Prime Formula has been erased from Usenet, the original 'social media' of the net.

That all being said, I'm constantly now being 'threatened' by who? Mods that think me insisting the removal of the original page is suspect to obvious manipulation most likely by the NSA?

Prove wiki has no NSA bots or mods controlling the discussion, put the page up and let it be edited properly. 

The original article was what I would think any real mod not working for the NSA would agree was pretty NPOV, and the 'cite' to github verified the whole claims, that a new prime algorithm is beating all known prime algorithms, something the other wiki page prime algorithms do not do.

The original article referenced the discover is connected to obvious 'disinfomation' as well, and the continued supression of anyone discussing his work and him as was done by wiki in this article is defacto proof that the PTB want to keep the public and academia in the dark about significant advancements in prime theory.

Anyone can google NSA and the major journals you think are 'peer reviewed', what do you see searching NSA and AMS, oh it's funded by the NSA. LOL

That's your 'peer review', so any real mod here can step in and put the original article back. The PyPrimes test of the algorithm shows how major this work is.

Then the public can decide who discovered it, I know the origin is 1995 and 1997, I've been following it that long, and to see wiki put up pages about a slow 60Mod algorithm from 2004 that was discussed in the same prime work in 1995 is a joke.

Then you start to peel away who are the guys involved in all this new crypto and prime work and you start to see nothing but NSA funded projects.

What you don't think the NSA had laws in place for decades banning such work? They did. And now they control the academic journals with funding to furthr control what is released about anything that can impact crypto and the heart of crypto is what, PRIME NUMBER THEORY.

The mere fact that a project that is open to PUBLIC SCRUTINY by competent computer programmers has shown for over two years a new prime algorithm is the so-called king of the hill of prime theory, and wiki mods and most likely NSA/wiki mods are doing their best to treat the PyPrimes speed tests like they are insignificant.

The fact is PyPrimes exposed how advanced the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni was by it beating all the major prime algorithms.

The fact is PyPrimes referred to the 1995 30Mod Prime algorithm as 'Croft Spirals', which is a joke since Croft created his site about the theory in 2010, then in 2012 PyPrimes picked it up, and now wiki is saying so what, there's a new prime algorithm that dethroned every prime algorithm wiki has pages on.

Prior to that, I think there had been progress in fixing the article, since February, and some of the other editors have been willing to compromise with new details inserted.

In the mediation phase, new people contacted their admin friends, and hence, we saw the recent abuses of admin power (deleting new images because they might be rejected at File-for-Deletion; blocking a user for posting a joke, etc.).

 Please take the advice you are being given 

Please calm down and familiarise yourself with how Wikipedia works. Your repeated shrill invocations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are frankly risible, makes you look foolish and shows a clear misunderstanding of what Wikipedia is and what it is not. Simply, talk pages of Wikipedia articles are not vehicles for individuals to impart their own unsupported viewpoints. You must understand this. You do not have the """"freedom"""" to hijack them for another purpose, to express your own view. Talk pages are there to discuss (supportable) improvements to the article, not for debate on the topic. If you intended to do so at Scots language your proposed improvement was not clear. For instance are we to extrapolate that your contention is that the topic doesn't exist, so neither should the article (in which case nominate for deletion)? Was it something else? All that is clear is your own POV, unsupported by any reliable evidence. The appropriate place for this type of postulation is not here on an article talk page - maybe start your own blog or discuss on chat rooms.

You clearly have either not read or not understood WP:NOTFORUM, which you have been directed to by several editors. Speaking of which, your portrayal of being thwarted by one individual is not accurate, though I'm not sure if this is due to you not having the skills to know this because of your newness as an editor. Numerous people have removed your soapboxing.

Now you are taking the inappropriateness of your posts to a bizarre new level by discussing your perceived martyrdom regarding your inadmissable soapboxing on Scots at Talk:Comparison of Norwegian Bokmål and Standard Danish. How on earth does this have any pertinence to improvement of the article on the comparison of Bokmål and Danish? That is why I am going to remove that section from that talk page.

Please also familiarise yourself with what a minor edit is. Adding or removing content, be it from a an article or a talk page is not a minor edit. Again you probably don't know that because you are new.

I hope you do take time to learn about how Wikipedia works and on that basis, and since you haven't been given a WP:WELCOME, I will post one below as it gives some other useful indications about how to edit here.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 some advice 

hi Hboetes.   You are new here and you don't understand the rules very well, much less the spirit that informs them - it is very very unwise to jump straight into a heated dispute as you are doing on the Michael Greger article.  Per the notice above you are edit warring, and if you continue doing that you are going to drive right over a cliff and get blocked.  So really  my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn!).  Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guidelines that govern our content.

I am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place.  Being an """"encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""" means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guidelines (PAG) to help provide a """"body of law"""" as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion.  Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west -  a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room brawl.   But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it.  One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is. (I keep emphasizing the spirit, because too often people fall prey to what we call """"wikilawyering"""")   The more I have learned about how things are set up here - not just the letter of PAG and the various drama boards and administrative tools, but their spirit -  the more impressed I have become at how, well ... beautiful this place is.   It takes time to learn both the spirit and the letter of PAG, and to really get aligned with Wikipedia's mission to crowdsource a reliable, NPOV source of information for the public (as """"reliable"""" and """"NPOV"""" are defined in PAG!).   People come edit for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that they are passionate about something.  That passion is a double-edged sword.  It drives people to contribute which has the potential for productive construction, but it can also lead to WP:TENDENTIOUS editing, which is really destructive.  WP:ADVOCACY is one of our biggest bedevilments. 

So don't edit war - discuss on the talk page. Ask authentic questions, not rhetorical ones, about what policies and guidelines are relevant to the content you care about.  good luck.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

d23f1fbaa796a1b0,"Audiences and level 

I left a comment to this effect on Talk:Boolean algebra (structure), but maybe here is a more appropriate place: I think a lot of this argument is over the wrong thing. Whether we're looking at these things as rings or lattices or fragments of formal logic or whatever is the wrong question. The right question is: who is the audience? And the answer is: there is more than one of them. At least as the current US college system is set up, many beginning computer science students need an article like Boolean algebra (logic) or Boolean logic, and would be baffled and lost by the mathematical formalism in Boolean algebra (structure). On the other hand, mathematicians from the advanced undergraduate level upwards would find those articles simplistic and useless, and need instead something like Boolean algebra (structure) or Boolean algebras canonically defined. We don't have to hide the fact that they're all really the same thing, but I think trying to make the freshman computer scientists learn ring theory in order to look up de Morgan's laws, or trying to make the math majors wade through lots of truth tables, would be a bad idea in either case.  And I think that trying to please both audiences in a single article would lead to a mess that's even worse than the current mess in Boolean logic. So, please do consider some merges — we have too many articles — but please don't take your one unified theory and insist that it's the only way the subject can be presented. —",0,0,0,0,0,0

Invitation and Recommendations for writing articles on Hindi Wikipedia

Hindi wikipedia invites and welcomes Wikipedians to contribute for the cause of spreading knowledge and the Hindi language. This page contains guidelines for writing a wiki-article on any topic at the Hindi Wikipedia, with special recommendations for writing in Hindi (Note: The script/font-family for Hindi is Devanāgari; the script/font-system for English is Roman script, also, the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized). This article is yet in English language (mostly), in order to encourage even non-native/foreign people who have learnt/are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia, and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English. The examples given below are only for explanation.

Recommendations:
Firstly for proper viewing, it is recommended to keep all links NOT-UNDERLINED. Otherwise the मात्रा below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines. For this, please go to My Preferences (मेरी पसंद) at the top of the page, then click Misc., and then choose """"underline links -> Never"""". Save your settings. Also, do not click yes for """"justify paragraphs"""", otherwise on some browsers, the devanagari script will appear highly distorted.
All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here, especially, to create new articles on general topics. They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles, and improve upon them. A non-user can also do the same; it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia. As far as possible, each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV)—no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome. The articles should be based on facts—and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed. See the English wiki's help page for editing in general. Almost all the general wiki-features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too. Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki.
Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages, users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English (or another) wikipedia's corresponding article and translate them for small articles. An in-page link to the English wiki's article will be deemed sufficient for references (a template might be created stating this). For longer articles, it is recommended to mention the references separately. 
Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western-type keyboard, it is best recommended (but not necessarily required) to use the virtual (software) keyboard like the one of Hindimozhi or of ISIS (Tavultesoft Keyman)—which are freewares. These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi-speakers in India often write messages/chat using Hindi words but written in Roman (English) script, and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use. For example, using the """"normal"""" keyboard with this software, typing ga would give ग and ghaa would give घा.
Create the article with its name written in Hindi (devanagari script). Always take care to include the nukta (dot below) for foreign / Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling. For non-Indian names, use that spelling (for article name and other words) which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers, G.K.-books, Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines. e.g., America-अमरीका (या अमेरिका), China-चीन, French-फ़्रांसिसी. For English acronyms/short-forms, use the initials in Roman script, and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form. e.g. IPA (अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय ध्वनि वर्णाक्षर); UNO (संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ). Doing the opposite is also fine. But creating the article with the Hindi short form, as सं०रा०सं०, is not recommended. Also, the article proper must be written with the proper nukta, as फ़ारसी, and then, a non-nukta (mis-)spelt version फारसी should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling.
Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the खड़ीबोली dialect (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu, i.e., बोलचाल वाली हिन्दी, which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic). The use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is in general neither required nor recommended. E.g., use: वजह instead of कारण, ख़ास instead of विशेष, वगैरह instead of इत्यादि, लेकिन instead of परन्तु etc. However, for technical and specialized vocabulary, the use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is recommended and usually",0,0,0,0,0,0

Generally the more dramatic mutations will be unviable and, in placentals mammals including humans, will usually be spontaneously aborted (can't remember the incidence of this in humans but it's surprisingly high; most mothers are unaware of it because such embryos usually abort before symptoms of pregnancy appear). Viable mutations are rare and small, which is why evolution is so slow by human standards.

An admin can block you again now that you've continued to make the very same contentious edit that got you blocked initially. If you continue to make that addition, which multiple editors have removed, and if you continue to refuse to discuss the issue on the article's talk page, this is fair warning that I will notify the above admin of your end-run disruptive editing.

Civility warning I

While we all offer edits which tend to improve the article, you need to exercise better caution in your edit summaries. [This] is not an example of civility; calling child is a fairly certain way to ensure your edits are met in the harshest possible light. In other words, knock off the bullshit sarcasm, or you won't like the ensuing discussion. - Jack Sebastian (talk) 
Allow me to be somewhat more clear: the next uncivil remark you make in an edit summary will find you taking a somewhat longer break than your previous block. We tend to block people for that sort of behavior. Consider my previous comment a request; consider this one a warning. - Jack Sebastian (talk) 
July 2012

The edits you have been reverting have not been made in bad faith, so they are not vandalism. You should also mind WP:3RR and your attitude. Someguy1221 (talk) 
Your recent edits

Information.svg Hello. In case you didn't know, when you add content to talk pages and Wikipedia pages that have open discussion, you should sign your posts by typing four tildes (    ) at the end of your comment. You could also click on the signature button Insert-signature.png or Button sig.png located above the edit window. This will automatically insert a signature with your username or IP address and the time you posted the comment. This information is useful because other editors will be able to tell who said what, and when they said it. Thank you. SineBot (talk) 
 Please stop attacking other editors, as you did on Juno Temple. If you continue, you may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. Your last edit summary referred to numerous editors on Juno Temple as morons. This is unacceptable and I noticed you have been warned for civility previously. If you believe the other editors are acting improperly, then report them to the appropriate Wikipedia noticeboard. If it is a content dispute, please work it out on the talk page. Thanks. Safiel (talk) 
Further comment on article Juno Temple
In your edit summaries, you indicate that you are relying on IMDB as a reliable source. Please read the following brief guideline at WP:IMDB. As a user edited resource, IMDB is not considered a reliable source for making material edits to an article. However, it is ok to make an external link from an article to an IMDB article. I am not taking sides as to whether you or the other editors are correct as to the dispute on Juno Temple, but IMDB is not an acceptable source for making your argument. Thanks. Safiel (talk)

Discussion
I prefer to act transparently. Can I give my views on that determination here?  insignis 
 I sent you an email message asking for your opinion. I think that is pretty transparent.   
 That is fine with me, but some editors don't like it. It was a neutral invitation to a discussion, but it would be more open on a talk page - I did have the wikibreak sign up though. Thanks for the message though, I didn't notice the discussion start.  insignis 
 I wrote it in an email message when possible because those kinds of notification are not worth writing on user talk pages – since there is nothing to talk about. However, in two cases the users' had no email listed and in those cases I did write it on their talk page. See User_talk:Sarsaparilla#Review_of_deletion_of_page_User:Prester_John and User_talk:Christopher_Mann_McKay#User:Prester_John. I did not know that policy you linked to. Thanks for that.   
That is a good point, no reply is necessary. By the way, it is not a policy, rather a 'behavioural guideline' - I hope it is helpful. Regards,  insignis

 Section Head Dispute  (moved from Talk:James I of England) 

Lets not argue about and revert each other's section breaks, please.  And it looks like you both just violated WP:3RR. This is just not important compared to the content, and may get this article protected or something else. We all had enough contentious editing in the past. Lets continue a civil debate and, who knows, maybe even come to consensus.  Stranger things have happened. Thank you. —   

I agree. Though, for the record, I """"only"""" undid the insertion of a section break above my post 3 times, no more. I am not sure how to further this discussion though. To me it seems the consensus is that James I quite obliviously was a person in the LGBT group.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Calton, it's hard to say what to do here. I have the feeling the whole sockpuppet thing is sort of like the O.J. case: the LAPD framed a guilty man. In other words, if all the puppets were subtracted from the three AfDs, I'm still not sure what the result would be. I'm guessing it would not be a consensus for deletion. (No, I'm not willing to do the math, but it looks like there have been a few attempts, themselves possibly puppet-infested.) 

I don't think the presence of sockpuppets supporting an article necessarily justifies its deletion, if the article is otherwise supportable. I think Canadian Federal election candidates from the major parties can reasonably be considered suitable for articles, but I can be persuaded otherwise. We'll see how it goes. In any case, thanks for the clarification about the accounts confirmed by CheckUser to be socks. (I agree that the whole VaughanWatch think, unlike Simon Strelchik et al., was totally out of control.) Cheers,  

Sir,
Having read your comments on this Deletion review, may I politely ask how many edits it is necessary to have undertaken (and am I right in assuming that you would only count constructive and unchallenged/unreverted edits) before one is qualified to comment on DRvs (and, I would assume, also AFD and similar issues) ??

 Developer access 

I actually agree that it makes sense to limit """"developer"""" access to a fairly small group of people.  I nominated the number of individuals I did chiefly because I felt that Angela and Mav, despite the value and extent of their contributions, represent the same ideological wing of the Wikipedian spectrum.  I thought it wise to diversity the group by including some Wikipedians who have different perspectives, like Fred and Martin, and some who are longtime contributors but tend to stay out of Wikipolitics altogether, like JohnOwens and the Anome.

By the way, if you're serious about limiting the number of developers, you may wish to prune the list to exclude people who were once very active but are no longer involved.  It isn't healthy (or secure) to include a bunch of emeriti on such lists.

 ==The SPÖ in Mein Kampf 

At one moment Hitler lauded the Social Democratic Party in his mind (Friedrich Austerlitz, Anton David, Viktor Adler and Wilhelm Ellenbogen are mentioned by their last names on p. 66 of Mein Kampf) for championing """"das allgemeine und geheime Wahlrecht"""" (Mein Kampf, p. 39) or universal suffrage, saying to himself that this must lead to a weakening of the so-hated-by-him Habsburg monarchic rule. When he later saw more of what the party was about however, he suggested its members were being servile to the Slavs to the point of debasing themselves, as one who is utterly mendicant, whilst disfavoring the Germans in an attempt to save the multiethnic melting pot of Austria-Hungary. It appears he was angered that he was asked to join the trade union and that men of Jewish heritage were influential in the party (Mein Kampf, pgs. 39, 40, 65 and 66).Mein Kampf, Erster Band, 2.

 bail out or bale out? 
For """"escape by parachute"""", my copy of Chambers Dictionary authorizes both spellings equally. I am British. I am more familiar with the spelling """"bale out"""". Perhaps this is yet another case where usual UK and USA spellings differ.  
First, """"bailing water"""" is never spelt baling water and I doubt you'd find that in Chambers.
For the parachute bailing, we use British English almost exclusively for the most part in Australia too, yet I've never once seen this use of bale (as in """"bale out of an aircraft"""") although it is evidently an alternate spelling of bail. But since """"bail out of an aircraft"""" is the way it's spelt at least 50% of the time in Britain and close to 100% of the time elsewhere (according to this WorldWideWords article), don't you think this information should go at the Bail disambig page on Wikipedia  and there is already a link to this from Bale.

Your usual obfuscation. There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural/free convection when forced convection (the common type that happens in car radiators) works just as well as illustration. Choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy (not heat) can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there. That means heat pumps don't really pump heat but rather energy. Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there, cannot even be defined! If you can't put a number on it you can't claim it's """"real """".

Temperature and thus kinetic energy may  play only minor roles in this, when energy of phase transitions is involved. For example water can be turned to steam and sent down a pipe to transfer energy by condensing somewhere else, and yet the temp changes are very small as small as you like for a given transfer. They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved. That's a clue that they aren't fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically. Physically it is potential energy being moved, not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there.

I'm struggling to see what the current dispute is about after my enforced spell in the slammer.  Karbinski argues for """"Philosophy is the science that studies the fundamental aspects of the nature of existence in order to provide man with a comprehensive view of life. Major branches of Philosophy include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Ethics, Politics, and Aesthetics. The word philosophy is of Ancient Greek origin: φιλοσοφία (philosophía), meaning """"love of knowledge"""", """"love of wisdom""""""""

I prefer a return to the main four branches.  Deleting the 'reasoned argument' part is not supported by the sources, of which there are plenty.  Philosophy would be a science in the original meaning of 'science' (scientia) but the modern meaning, while not entirely different, has connotations that it would be best to avoid.  On whether the philosophy of language belongs in the main branches, that is debateable.  My view, given the dominance of the 'Old Logic' (the Categories and On Interpretation) and of the importance of those two to the Metaphysics, I would say it does belong.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You cannot just go out and make a Lord of the Rings film without the required licensing, since all LOTR films are made from the same intellectual property. The Peter Jackson series is not a franchise, it is one instance of an independently produced series in a franchise that includes multiple adaptations across multiple media. Batman is similar: Batman is a franchise that includes comics, multiple independent adaptations and merchandise. We could just have a chart of each independent series, but that would mean separating the Batman films, separating the Spider-Man films etc, but the chart does this anyway, because you can just expand the entries. The article retains a neutral point of view on what data we present, since readers may be just as interested in the collective value of the whole Batman franchise as opposed to just one series in it; on the other hand, they must just be interested in the Nolan series. Either way it doesn't matter because both sets of data are given. Likewise with the Middle Earth films, the reader has access to how much the franchise has earned as a whole, how much the Jackson series has earned as a whole, and how much just the LOTR trilogy within the Jackson series has earned as a whole. It covers all possible ways a reader might want to interpret the information. As for the information being out of date, there is usually a short lag between Sunday-Monday as the data is released and then update in the chart.

There were several city-states like Athens, Sparta and so on, and later, in the middle ages there was the Byzantine Empire and its succesors such as the Despotate of Morea, and so on. None of those souvereign entities was called Greece (nor Hellas, Ellas etc.). Of course all of them play an important part in the Greek history and culture, so the Greek people claim them as their own, however its the statehood continuity we are talking about here. The modern Greek state was created in 1825 and thats the only real beginning of the story, before that territory was Ottoman Turkey, before that: Byzantine Empire, before that Roman Empire, before that.. and so on.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

08a70fd81e135893,"Yes you got it - the Govt lied.  See the talk page for CSELR (OK, I'm lazy and not typing current page name!).  They provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from.  I have provided the link to the index of papers produced (mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw) so you can confirm that the Business case was never provided.  There are no source documents for any figure contained in the Business Case Summary.  Some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and post-TfNSW publications (such as with the Capacity claimed by GB on the MR for the Modification Approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are 50% lower.).

 I am one of 8 community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about.  That is why I have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language.  The minutes for the Community Rep meeting with TfNSW are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions.  The terms of reference (open to the public to see) for the Community Rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet TfNSW are refusing to do this.  I have since discovered that 4 of the community reps are current employees of the State Govt and 1 is a past (self-proclaimed) senior executive of TfNSW.  So not only do they not tell the truth - they have also stacked the Community Reference Group.

As discussed, the continuum does involve aerobic muscle fibers even in primarily anaerobic activities. They simply don't contribute much to the overall effort. Again see the chart here. The aerobic component is well less than 5% for activities well past the low rep high weight range. Even if it were 20% aerobic component, that would still qualify as primarily anaerobic. Do you have some reliable sources for this idea of yours that low rep high weight trainging provides an important aerobic training component?

While you and me know what 'Religious Violence in India' typically refers to, a year from now it will refer to what the article's name suggest, with a new batch of trolls and POV pushers revert warring every edit. The article was created to quench the India-bashing thirst. At least I fail to see any other reason for its existence, because otherwise we wouldn't be discussing what the article really refers to etc.
Also, don't forget then the anti-Hindu violence, specially in southern India and eastern India - places where Hindus are in minority. And don't forget that the riots are never one sided. Right now the article looks like a list of religious atrocities committed in India, which is a ridiculous topic, but I believe it can be turned into a comprehensible and well cited article. That's why I think going according to """"time"""" will help.

But there is no cherry picking. The article contains the most reliable information. There are many studies presented by religiously affiliated/motivated institutions and scientists. That's not reliable. There are studies presented by outright bigots. That's not reliable. There are studies that claim to show one thing, but do not. That's not reliable. The organizations in the article, which have membership in the hundreds of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world, are not unreliable nor do they present subjectively biased conclusions based on what they studied. Pointing out a difference, for example, of a male child of two lesbians not being as aggressive as the male child of a man and woman is very trivial. The conclusions that the scientific world has come to is that, while there may be some isolated differences, which exist in all types of families not just those with same-sex parents, it is inconceivable to make the generalization that one is better or more efficient than the other. The only contrasts which my have significant differences are those families who do not have two parents, no matter their gender. So there is no rational basis, in my mind and obviously the mind of most studied science on this, to even try to contradict that. –  (talk · email) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

832, In the heading it says: """"Notable roles"""". The three previous mentions were roles that the play and/or film, Truman was the main subject, taking up the bulk of screen/stage time and lines. These also won critical acclaim. The combination of the amount of script and praise is what made these portrayals of Truman notable. Does your addition really fit: """"Notable""""? There have been lots of roles with Truman in them:

Flags of Our Fathers (2006) Played by David Patrick Kelly (as President Truman)
Hiroshima (2005) (TV) Played by Kenneth Jay (as Truman)
The Messenger: Based on a True Story (2005) Played by Raymond Starzmann (as President Truman)
Keep the Faith, Baby (2002) (TV) Played by Cedric Smith (as U.S. President Truman)

Eleanor, First Lady of the World (1982) (TV) Played by Richard McKenzie
Inchon (1981) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)
Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb (1980) (TV) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S Truman)
""""Backstairs at the White House"""" (1979) TV series Played by Harry Morgan (as President Harry S. Truman)
MacArthur (1977) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)... aka MacArthur, the Rebel General (UK) 
Tail Gunner Joe (1977) (TV) Played by Robert Symonds (as President Harry S. Truman)
Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders
Truman at Potsdam (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S Truman)
Collision Course: Truman vs. MacArthur (1976) (TV) Played by E.G. Marshall (as President Harry S Truman)... aka Collision Course (USA: short title) 
Give 'em Hell, Harry! (1975) Played by James Whitmore (as Harry S Truman)
The Man from Independence (1974) Played by Robert Vaughn (as Harry S Truman)
The Beginning or the End (1947) Played by Art Baker (as President Harry S. Truman)

But, Give 'em Hell, Harry! and Truman, both on stage and screen where entirely about Truman. In Give 'em Hell (if you have seen it), there is nobody else. It is a one-man play, 100% of the lines are portraying Truman. And Flanders played Truman at least four times, including the bulk of the work being about him in at least two occasions; Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking and Truman at Potsdam. So, is his charactership in Flags of Our Fathers really """"notable""""?

Wait...how can the creators of Liberalism be called classical liberals, if Liberal means something different than its classic form?  Furthermore, how can something be classic when it was once origina.  Don't you see that Liberalism had to become classic liberalism because many people strayed from its beliefs by changing its core values and meanings?  Thus, I do not see a problem with mentioning how classical liberals believe themselves to be the true liberals and that """"modern welfare statist liberals"""" have perverted the meaning.  

Libertarians are a reaction from the virtual elimination of liberals/classical liberals from the political scene as both Democrats and Republicans continued to abandon their beliefs on freer markets and limited government.  Thats it.  There are various levels of libertarians and free market advocates, and only a few of them advocate anarchism.  I think you conflate free market with anarchy.  Furthermore, I think you've failed to realize that Milton Friedman considers himself a liberal while being a member of the REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!

Another supposed noted American libertarian is John Stossle, and he hates the term libertarian, he prefers to call himself a liberal but the meaning is something different from what it once was so he reluctantly refers to himself as a classical liberal for the less informed, or a libertarian for the most ignorant.

Furthermore, there has never been a laissez-faire American life. This is bogus leftist/tory propoganda.

HHHH Here is a clarification. The original Semitic people came from Arabia, they moved north and east. After time, the Semitic people devised many dialects of """"Semitic"""". Those dialects became known as """"Languages"""" after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic & for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab.

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. - 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 For willmcw 

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. - 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. - 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, """"Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade."""" Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.

 Ncmvocalist's questions 

Hello Rootology. You've made a series of comments at the block review (for the block imposed on Ikip), and you later reversed Ikip's block. I would request that you answer my questions as promptly as possible. 

 Have you made any attempts to communicate with the blocking admin prior to your unblock? If so, how many minutes elapsed between your attempts to communicate with the blocking admin, and your unblock?
 You have stated to AMIB: """"You as an admin have zero standing or authority to levy this block as one of the deepest """"deletionist"""" partisans on this site, just as anyone deeply involved in the squadron would have zero standing or authority to undo it."""" Can you please provide diffs to support this claim?
 In saying to AMIB: """"You must undo this block and not do such a thing again, or you will not be long for your tools once the Arbitration Committee sees what you're about"""", can you clarify what you meant?
 You've stated to AMIB: """"You pretty much missed the goal as far right as you can on this one, for being involved."""" Can you provide diffs for this claim? 

Thanks.   

Hi. Blocks and admin actions are never sacrosanct, unless they are from the Arbitration Committee as a body or cited as an OFFICE action. Any can be reversed once by any admin in good faith with justification. I provided my justifications here. For your specific questions:
 We were talking in the ANI thread. That is classically regarded as sufficient, but I posted the diffs that he was going to pull for him. There's no canvassing for days before the block. Since blocks are preventative by policy and not punative, the block automatically has no standing. I re-opened the archived discussion, that Abd closed, so that my unblock can be reviewed and re-instated by any uninvolved admin if required.
 This would take a long while to gather it all, but a long-standing user's leanings are hardly secret. I'm a BLP zealot most times; Ikip is an inclusionist; DGG is an inclusionist; JoshuaZ is an inclusionist; AMiB is a deletionist; Phil Sandifer is an inclusionist. 
 Admins have repeatedly been told by the AC (and policy) that they may not use tools in areas in which they are involved. My strongly-worded suggestion was so that another good admin doesn't fall down that hole.
 See #3. Again, any demonstratably uninvolved admin can freely reverse my unblock, I waive all wheel warriness, etc.

AMIB has replied to my unblock, by the way, on that thread.  (C)(T) 

Okay; just to note that it was very appropriate of you to revert the closing and leave the thread open, for the reasons you've stated. 

There are a couple of things I'd like to clarify for future incidents. If AMIB had participated in that particular deletion discussion, then using his tools would likely be inappropriate. Alternatively (as may be the case here), if AMIB had been involved in personal and direct conflict with Ikip, especially if it was recent, then his use of tools would not be appropriate. Such involvement can cloud judgement. However, mere general participation in other deletion debates/discussions is not necessarily enough for an admin to be considered """"involved"""".

(outdent) How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games """"SHALL NOT"""" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed. To play that game required (it being rules heavy, that really is pretty much true) a minimum of two books—the DM Guide and the Players' Handbook. Neither """"contained"""" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either. The game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books, magazine articles, supplements, pamphlets, online articles and what was in the head of the players. The book is about the game; it is not the game.  

For that matter, a number of the articles you tagged did not list an ISBN, so you can't really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the ISBN. A publisher doesn't mean it's a book, as board games, computer games, and any number of things are published and have publishers.

asssiveego has posted his RfA and I have blocked him for it

Hello. I have blocked Masssiveego for his antics on Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Masssiveego which seems like a clear attempt to draw fire from people bitter with his own antics on RfA, with a minimalist nomination and tongue-in-cheek answers to the questions. He seems to have induced a bite from Pschemp at least. This lasts for a week. I previously did this for Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/The Mad Bomber for trolling his own RfA. Please review and feel free to protest on my talk page. Blnguyen | BLabberiNg 

Sounds about right. Cyde Weys 

    Good call  Samir धर्म 

        I don't see any issues with this block. Pure WP:POINT. Can we close the RfA? (Or does it need to be a 'crat?) alphaChimp laudare 

I was thinking of blocking him myself, so obviously I endorse the block. It's rather obvious that he's trolling for attention with all this RfA stuff... let's just not feed him and move on. W.marsh 

RFA has been closed. Support block. – Chacor 

                Hey should I close it then? It's already WP:SNOWballing with opposes and he is blocked after all. - Glen  - shit - 4 edit conflicts later its been done S

                    Sheesh, if you use the shortcut at least shorten the verb to WP:SNOWing. I want snow! P – Chacor 

                        I added an extra day to the block for [33] and [34]. CanadianCaesar Et tu, Brute? 

[edit]

Exhausting community patience?

Once again, it's time to bring this up. He's coming close to exhausting the community's patience, in my view. Thoughts? – Chacor 

    Not yet. I would not have blocked him at all for starting the RfA. In fact i think SNOWing this RfA was a bad idea. Rather I would have let it run the full 7 days. Having 100+ opposes might have finally gotten through to this editor that he needs to reconsider his approach. But with the RfA snowed, he's got ammo to say we aren't treating him right, etc. ++Lar: t/c 

        Perhaps, but there just isn't a reason to let trolls stay. – Chacor 

            Is this user a flat out troll? Sure, close the book right away... Or, is he rescuable? if rescuable is it worth the effort? that's how I evaluate the question of whether community patience is exhausted. I don't think ME is a flat out troll. His contributions are light so not a LOT of effort is justified but I'm not convinced he is not rescuable. Contrast with Tobias, next thread. CLEARLY not a troll, has a big contribution record, therefore worth a fair bit of effort, but I'm starting to think... not rescuable. Make sense? ++Lar: t/c 

Would we simply be gratifying him by letting the RfA run? Blnguyen | BLabberiNg 

    Hard to say. I'm not too sussed either way but I did want to throw out that on balance, gratified or not, this is one time that SNOW isn't the right thing to do. In my view anyway. ++Lar: t/c 

        I think closing it was the right thing to do to avoid disruption. Blocking him... I don't know whether he's a good faith user or not, and I suspect probably not, but I'm generally upset by the level of blocking going on in Wikipedia at the moment. The Land 

    * I think the Masssiveego's RFA voting is a problem and unhelpful, but I think imposing blocks for it is a rather drastic measure. A much better """"penalty"""" would be for the RFA closing bureaucrats to systematically disregard his votes. Regarding the RFA, I agree with Lar that I would not have blocked him for that either, and that a hundred """"oppose""""s on what is in effect an editor peer review might convey the message far more clearly than a block ever will. Sjakkalle (Check!) 
    * I agree with Lar and Sjakkalle. Haukur 
    * Users are allowed to use whatever criteria they like in RfAs. His are high and somewhat arbitrary, but that's his perogative. He feels that there are problems with some admins and thus that the process should be more strict/changed. He has a right to that opinion and should not be persecuted for it. Obviously his RFA self-nom wasn't meant to be a serious attempt, but I also don't see where it caused any significant disruption justifying a block. CBD

Well, first of all, it's not my """"personal summary""""; I didn't even write the paraphrase.

I think this is just a bit silly that you can't see your own biases. Why can't you see your own biases? Or had you considered the fact a good majority of Wikipedia editors share a Left of center POV by Jimmy Wales' own admission? The bias is hardly in a conservative direction, or even neutral. How can you say there isn't a decided hostility to conservative or traditional points of view on Wikipedia
Wikipedia's NPOV rule is meaningless, considering this fact. Explain to me why you think my observation of fact is absurd? Wikipedia isn't a reliable source because this fact, and if you hadn't been reading students in colleges in America, at least, are discouraged from citing it because of serious factual errors and political biases that pass for the truth. 
The problem here IS NOT with me.  
Guy, I wish you could see how the world views Wikipedia, and it's not good. Wikipedia's NPOV rule is symbolic, and from what I have seen no one here follows it. I have read all of the rules,and I have made every effort to follow them. Do everyone a favor and declare that Wikipedia is a Left-wing site. e.g.,  a blog. It comes down to an ideosyncratic application of the rules to fit your worldviews.
FM writes for the Democratic Underground, Jim68sch has confessed to having Marxist sentiments and you have confessed to being sympathetic to homosexuality. So, how can you say that there isn't a Left of center bias on Wikipedia?  I am mentioning the fact I Googled FM's handle, and found posts under his handle on the decidedly Liberal/Socialist Democratic Underground because it shows where his political biases lay.
How then can he be anymore objective than I?
FM said I weakened his viewpoint that Dominionism was a threat or a problem by adding the viewpoints of self-professed Christian Reconstructionists to the Dominionism article. How can you say that he's neutral anymore than I am neutral. My beef with that particular article is that it seems to stereotype all conservative American Christians as wanting to replace the U.S. Constitution with a neo-Puritan theocracy. 
Wikipedia lacks the same quality as Encyclopedia Britannica when it comes to maintaining a non-partisan perspective?
I consider myself knowledgeable about the Christian right, at least the Catholic faction therof, and I object to what I see as the blatant stereotyping of conservative Christians. The fact Chip Berlet or Katherine Yurica are considered """"experts"""" furthers my perception of bias. Mr. Berlet, I will concede, is more factual than say Ms. Yurica, but he paints with a very broad brush that ignores the diversity of the Christian right.
Their writings are riddled with strawman attacks, guilt by association, glaring generalizations, etc. The series of articles on """"Dominionism"""" are riddled with factual errors and POV. Is it NPOV to limit the content to a single POV where only those who share a single POV are granted """"expert"""" status?
I will leave Wikipedia alone for awhile, and perhaps limit myself to editing on the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox-oriented pages. When it comes to politics, Wikipedia is of limited informative value.

I would say that the bottom line is if independent reliable sources describe Cox as Catholic, then we can go with that. The difference is that Cox belongs to a schismatic organization that is several levels removed from the Catholic Church. Williamson, in his association with the SSPX, was directly ordained by a Catholic Church bishop and remained Catholic, even while not in full communion. Note that the Catholic Church affirmed that attendance at an SSPX chapel would fulfill the Sunday obligation, i.e. in a """"Catholic rite"""". I do not know if the Catholic Church has commented on the canonical status of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, or the validity of the Thuc line of apostolic succession.

I can reference 40 articles in a day, 1/3 of the 124 proposed, this is very doable folks.
I would strongly encouarge you to support this proposal. It is very doable. 
I am actively working to notify other wikiprojects of several tools, see for example:

As User:The-Pope wrote on my talk page:
The WP:Australia project had a list of over 2000 names just over 2 weeks ago. It's now under 900.  900 is still fairly unworkable, so we've split them up again into smaller topics. Other lists have popped up, Cricket, Rugby union, India and probably many more.   This is all do-able, but it does take time, it does get a bit boring, it can be tempting for some editors to put the first google hit they see on it and remove the tag, but it can work.  One other good thing about these lists, is that you can use the related changes link to see all edits to them... great to keep an eye on pages without clogging up your watchlist (almost like having multiple watchlists). 
This is very possible.

 Sorry, WilyD, but re-stating a flawed argument doesn't validate it. You're starting from the standpoint that the one true meaning of a word is the one used in a single place and, thus, all other different uses of the word are invalid. This is not true. Although movies and books have made """"American"""" an understood term for """"from the United States"""" in most countries """"American"""" is used for the landmass and not the country. In Latin America (which comprises far more people than the USA itself) the term """"Americano"""" is used for the landmass and the continents, not for a country. This may sit well because as you've implied """"America"""" has always been for you your country and while this is respectable it doesn't mean your opinion is more valid that the one from those that don't share it. Incidentally, stating that only your local opinion is valid is as much soapboxing as you're trying to lay on others. Unless the Wikipedia is suddenly defined to be formally U.S.A.-Centric (and being in english obviously doesn't count) then """"rest-of-the-world"""" views are perfectly acceptable. This page exists, in part, to make it clear that """"American"""" is not always a demonym of the USA and this is a fact. As much a fact as U.S. citizens believen it does.

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved, as you did at Japan Focus. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability.

Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue.

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections.

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

Biased section on Turkey

""""Turkey On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]"""""""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide. Turtlescrubber  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime). Andranikpasha  
Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information.

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section. Raman, Massachusetts —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

The section is grossly biased in favor of Pelosi-s pro-armenian stance and justification. She wants to sell something which didn't happen due to funds she receive from the Armenian lobby. 
She wants to compare the armenian killings with those of Jews genocide and Rwanda genocide. She forgets following differences between these events. 

Nationalist Armenians were at war with the Turks in 1915 (both in Anatolia and Caucausus), and the Armenian generals and guerilla leaders who commanded them are still honored as Armenian heroes today. Military leaders like Generals Andranik Oznanian, Garegin Nzhdeh, Drastamat Kanahyan (“General Dro”), and Garo Pasdirmaijan (“Armen Garo”) are largely unknown to Americans whose knowledge of Armenian history is limited to the orthodox genocide literature, but well-known by Armenians. Here, again, the analogy to the Jews of the Holocaust simply does not fit. There are no statues to the Jewish generals who fought the Nazis in Germany in 1942-43, because there were none.

There doesn't seem too much about druids here.  Yes, the article explains the different shpeshifts fairly indepth, but I think that needs some explaining.  Druids have one of the more richer back stories and lore than any other class and I think that needs to be touched upon.  It seems like whoever wrote the section on druids just did it to get it out of the way so they can talk about how shadow preists are the best at pvp =).  

I'd do it myself but: a.) I don't have any experience writing stuff for wiki, and b.) maybe a more experienced WoW player could write it up better than I could.  If nothing else, I think the shapeshift section could be shortened slightly to make way for more room on lore and Druids in general.

2e22c9c8934c71dd,""":::Oooh, """"You're wrong! You're wrong! You're wrong!"""".  Why am I not impressed by your 'debate skills'. 
First, until 3 weeks ago, I had never heard the term, """"meat puppet"""".   Perhaps you're trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean, no more and no less.  (Shades of Alice in Wonderland, I suppose.)  I will have to find the definition of that term.  But I view it as a problem when self-selected, biased individuals (even if there is no actual coordination involved) seem to coordinate their postings.  Dodo ran away, that's a fact.  He didn't address my actual criticisms of his actions:  he simply threw a few templates, as if that was the end of the argument.  (But, those templates were not merely mis-applied, they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute.)  Dodo couldn't be bothered to address them, and for a 'good' (at least, for him!) reason:  If Dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct, and debate the propriety not merely of the original post, but also his own misdeeds, then Dodo would be so busy he couldn't continue his 'drive-by reversions' of peoples' articles.  Dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits, repeatedly.  He was unwilling to explain why he didn't wait for consensus.  Etc.
And, it is a fact that 'nobody' addressed Dodo's (at least arguable) misconduct, even if (hypothetically) they also objected to something I did, too.  Why should that be?  There's an 'excellent' reason:  I think the kind of people who did post (self-selected, of course, one would expect) may very well have felt they were defending 'one of their own'.  I repeat my point that if I had time (and access to reversion/deletion statistics) it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of Dodo: Revert, Revert, Revert!   And, not to bother with any 'consensus'.  (""""We don't need no stinkin' consensus!"""").  Such persons would be fearful of 'outing' Dodo's pattern of action, and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism.  Am I wrong?  I invite somebody else to study their statistics, and explain why there's no 'pattern' there.

 Nevis West Indies 

Hello Pia, yes I am the guy who kept changing my link on the Tourism section of Nevis.  I am sorry I really did not understand how Wikepedia worked.  For years I had a link that read

Nevis1 - The """"Non-Tourist-Trap"""" Guide To Nevis, West Indies.  Then somebody changed the description.  I did not realize that it was an administrator changing the link.  I just thought somebody was fooling around with the link, so I kept changing it back.  Unfortunately I did not notice the spam warning until it was too late.  I did stop changing the link then, but alas I think it was too late.

I found your post to ohnoitsjamie very interesting, and you touched on some good points, however I really do feel that my site should be listed in the Nevis Wiki.  You mention that I have villas that people pay to list, yest that is true, but it pays for my time and my server costs.  Geographia also charges to be on their site and their information is wasy out of date.  You also mention adense, but geographia also has adsense.

Speedy deletion of Teens with tnt
 A tag has been placed on Teens with tnt, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. -  from SRK.o//(Talk) (Contribs)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Kosovo is the drug-trading hot-spot, and so is Albania. Half of the population of Albania are still farmers, using tools that were used centuries ago.

Now, as far as wars are concerned, Albanians have, only in the last 15 years, started three, one in Kosovo, one in South Serbia (Presevo Valley), and one in Macedonia. All were wars of secession, wherever they go, they want to separate. This is not propaganda, this is fact, and anyone in the world can check it.

You made a serious mistake in interpretation, which seems normal for those who are not specialists in entomology and taxonomy in the dipterous ones.  But, please show me once again that I make an attack with the person of Rognes, because I must explain you where you did not understand.

Thus, you can note that Rognes is the only amateur faunist (and not a recognized specialist), who wishes to make """" revolutions """" in taxonomy, without knowing Bengaliidae, without knowing the morphology of dipterous (in general), without being able to make a correct identification according to the male genitalia even of usual Calliphoridae.  In more he wanted to introduce an aberrant and specific terminology for his pupils of the school of handicappers of Stavanger (Norway) where he works, and was unaware of always the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.  All its """" research """" is not recognized by the community of the specialists.  Only his friends of the same structure, namely:  Thomas Pape (the recognized intellectual robber and the most stupid taxonomist nowadays), C Thompson, N.L. Evenhuis, J.E. O' Hara and (unfortunately) A. C. Pont wrote a bibliographical work, nonscientific, in which they mentioned exactly what I have says to you before on Rognes.  He cannot identify any species of Bengaliidae and he does not have competence to establish that Bengalia testacea  is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  This false type was mentioned before by Sabrosky in a stupid work of bibliography (nonscientific), in collaboration with the same ignoramuses collaborators (1999:62).  You must know exactly that of Zumpt until Lehrer, the species-type of the Bengalia kind is Bengalia labiata R.D. - not B testacea sensu Duponchel 1842 & Rognes, which is a nomen nudum. 

Thus, for the exactitude of your encyclopaedic information you must change distort them given.  Moreover, I give you the council of reading certain articles documented by Lehrer in Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2010, 23: 1-`22 and 22-25;  24:16-20 and 20-23;  26:  21-30 [ [ http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Z._Lehrer ] ] and the work: LEHRER& WEI, 2010, Un nouveau genre oriental de la famille Bengaliidae (Diptera), Bull.

 Objectivity of Circumcision article should be flagged due to Gilgal Fellows on salary who patrol & edit the article 

As a matter of curiosity

As a matter of curiosity, if a person with a Circumcision Fetish found his way to this article, would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer? By the way, the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page 5 of the WHO pamphlet, """"Global Trends,"""" would indicate that the purported HIV protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions. Would that also target the English-speaking readers of a wiki site like Wikipedia? ... Anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the Gilgal Fellows  perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work. Joe Circus (talk) 

    Unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest. I have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world African HIV studies on our modern audience to no avail. Garycompugeek (talk) 

        Thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. Since there are a number of fellows who edit this article, it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the Gilgal Fellows described here It could be revelatory for Circumcision Wikipedia to include a section on the Gilgal Fellows, who apparently have quite a mission. It's my understanding that GILGAL is an obscure word for MOUNTAIN OF BURNING FORESKINS. Joe Circus (talk) 

            No one having objected to the proposed sections on Circumcision Fetish and the Gilgal Fellows, I will assume a consensus, delegate the research, and get back here with it ASAP. Joe Circus (talk) 

                It's impossible to assess such a vague proposal. If you provide some specific, sourced content, we can assess its suitability. Jakew (talk) 

                    """"...we can assess..."""" Now would that be the Royal We or you claim to speak for other fellows? Joe Circus (talk) 

                        """"We"""" refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal. Jakew (talk) 

                            All the same, I don't get why YOU in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission. It'll take a lot of Human resources to put these sections together... and if the """"consensus"""" is already fixed in advance, what's the point? Joe Circus (talk) 

                                Perhaps it's a little presumptuous, but it's realistic. It's usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change; take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.
                                As for your proposals, previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a """"circumcision fetish""""; searching Google Scholar for """"Gilgal Society"""" indicates that there are no reliable, secondary sources regarding that subject either. So I would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies. Jakew (talk) 

                                    """"Our"""" policies?... You mean the Gilgal Fellows? I'm not certain WHO you're representing here. Joe Circus (talk) 

                                        Wikipedia's policies, obviously. Jakew (talk) 

                                            Another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason. In trying to improve the Circumcision article, it's important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article. That's not a personal attack, nor a lack of presumption of good will. It's merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article, and a healthy cynicism about some readers' intransigence. One reader has left a very rude & domineering comment on my user page. If personal attacks like that are the norm, I can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article, and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page.

Infoboxes have their limitations.  This is one of them.  Have another look at my post to the talk page; your input appears to be sincere yet also has missed nearly all of the referenced points I was making:
In the post-Reconstruction, pre-WWI United States, the """"N-word"""" was far less transgressive than it is today.
That particular word has undergone such a dramatic reduction in social acceptability that it must be presented within context, if at all.
This isn't because of the word's offensiveness to modern sensibilities per se; it's because twenty-first century readers would not understand its use as a nickname for a white man and would have no point of reference for how it would become a badge of honor to him.  Context must be provided or else it is shocking and misleading rather than informative.
It may not be possible or necessary to contextualize that moniker adequately within the bounds of WP:NPOV, specifically WP:UNDUE.  The nickname is a minor part of Pershing's life and career.  A similar nickname in Irving Berlin's biographical background has more than twice the returns on Google Books, yet is not mentioned in his Wikipedia biography.

Patrick Walsh on the role of """"extreme rightwing"""" Agent-Provocateurs
As documented by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police undercover agent, Mr. Patrick Walsh, in a recently published book in Canada, """"The Unholy Alliance"""", Zionists have played a major role in promoting """"Nazi"""" and other allegedly anti-Jewish movement. The much publicised """"Nazi"""" leader Lincoln Rockwell was a creature of the Zionist terror machine, and played a major role in persuading rich American Jews that they should contribute to the Zionists, who would protect them from threatened """"anti-Semitism"""". Patrick Walsh thoroughly exposes the role of the agent provocateur. The Walsh exposures have, according to Canadian reports, thrown the Zionists and their dupes into some confusion. 

Patrick Walsh would have been most interested to hear Andrew Campbell's strong objection to a recent reference to """"Zionist thuggery"""". He was the victim of this thuggery when brutally attacked by a group of Jewish Defence League members outside a room in the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, who were attempting to break up a school being conducted by Eric Butler. Zionist thuggery has been used against lawful patriotic groups right around the world. The League of Rights has constantly warned against extending encouragement to any type of violence, stressing that evil policies can be defeated through the British system of constitutional government.

That's not an objection to merging, it's an argument in favour of merging, with one aspect contained within another in the same article. We all know that there was historical concept of a 'Nordic race'. No-one disputes that. The question is whether there is any point having a separate article about it, distinct from the cultural and ideological uses to which it has been put. If both can managably be contained in the same article, then they should be. The Mediterranean race article contains both aspects, and so should this one. The title is rather a separate question. Nordic theory is a name that was created by user:fastfission to merge the term Nordic race with the idea that the concept became historically significant because there were specific theories about it. After all, that's what makes this page different from the others. This topic has a long, sometimes acrimonious, Talk page. If you look up Mediterranean race there is far less discussion, and there is almost none on Alpine race or Dinaric race. I don't mind what the title is, but the difference in title does reflect the reality that theories about this issue have been historically and ideologically significant, while theories about other European """"sub-races"""" have been purely academic.

a1e13fc789597488,""":Ali, as I've wrote, none of those authors are aware of many important details, such as Kurekchay Treaty - an official and legal treaty which defined the entry of Karabakh into Russian empire. At the same time, the khan of Sheki too signed a similar treaty, for example. I know Michael Croissant, and his book is full of mistakes and errors, his book doesn't mean much in this regard. His mistakes are too gross  the Russo-Iran war started in 1806, whilst Karabakh became part of Russia in 1805 before such a war. Meanwhile, Tim Potier is a good legal expert, and it is surprizing to see him write that. But everyone is entitled to errors and his was due to lack of resources - he was limited as a scholar in variety of materials and legal status of Karabakh in 19th century was not his objective  the 20th century was. Anyways, I do not know the khans of Iran in the south and which treaties they concluded with British. If they did it in the Zand period, they probably had full legal right at the time, since Iran was more of a geographic entity, than political. Same with Azerbaijan (North) - it was geographic too. Whilst I do not remember the legal documents and letters of the time, the later Russian and British documents clearly identified Azerbaijanis of the North as """"aderbeijani tatars"""" - I have evidence of that as far back as 1880 in British census estimates and in the 1897 official Russian Imperial Census. Same word is used by Russian ethnographer Velichko in his 1903 book. Azerbaijani author, Firudin bey Kocharly wrote a book in 1908 """"Literature of Azerbaijani Turks"""". 

Anyways, Azerbaijanis simultaneously fought against both Iran and Russia at the time, and some sided with either one side or another. Unfortunately, you won't find much on that in libraries - but just one such translated book would allow scholars to reconsider mistaken assumptions. What is more important however, is that Karabakh khan (khan being a Turkic term derived from kagan), was that it concluded its own treaty, that it minted its own money (one of the typical examples of independence), and fought several wars with Iran, some handily winning, others, like 1797, ambgiously  but still Shah Muhammed Qajar gets killed. And I don't know who told you about Vagif and Ibrahim  by the later you probably mean Ibrahim khan, right? Well, Vagif, the poet and vizier, was executed in 1797, AFTER shah's death, and was executed by the temporary ruler, Mamed bey Jevanshir, who was nephew of Ibrahim khan. While details are murky and contradictory, the Qajars didn't have the primary rolse in this  indeed, once shah was killed, Iranian troops withdrew, it screwed up all the plans to re-conquering other parts of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Meanwhile, Ibrahim khan lived and ruled the khanate until tragic error - or so it is explained  in 1806. But anyway, the Kurekchay Treaty was signed by him. Thus, once more, Karabakh khanate, for one, was totally independent, and Iran had no legitimate or otherwise claims whatsoever to it. Meanwhile, few other khanates were nominally dependent - like Poland was to USSR, or Armenia to Russia (Russian speaker of Parliament, #3 person in the country, openly called it """"forepost of Russia"""" whilst in Armenia).

The aim of this article (and any other Wikipedia article) is that it accurately reflect reliably sources.  Since intelligent design is a fringe subject, it's also important that we don't present it as it were mainstream science.  
There are atheists (and even a few agnostics) that considered ID a viable hypothesis long before the Discovery Institute was founded.  So, the use of the word """"all"""" in the opening paragraph is just petty and wrong.  Well, no.  All of the major proponents do appear to be associated with the DI.  No one is arguing that there were no ID proponents before the DI existed.  But as far as we can glean from reliable sources, they all ended up associated with the DI.

Possible Original Research:
I only skimmed through on these parts, but it seems to me that most of this needs to be cited - either for verification, or simply for the sake of further reading.

1. French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L'Hexagone (The """"Hexagon"""") because of the geometric shape of its territory.

Unless it was a Frenchman or Frenchwoman who added that in, how can we know for certain that they really do? Is this self-made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it's a surefire fact? Unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question, It needs a citation.

2. There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.

Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave. This word still exists in French as franc, it is also used as the translation of """"Frank"""" and to name the local money, until the use of the Euro in the 2000s.

However, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank, it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means """"Realm of the Franks"""". In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, Modern France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Realm is called Frankenreich.

Now here we're talking about cite-cite-cite-for-crying-out-loud-cite! Some of this might not only be original research, but speculation, also! Two Wikipedia-no-nos riddled into one!

So now you've changed your story of The Hours for the third time, eh? (Or is it fourth? Fifth? I seem to be losing count as you approach the limits of my pitifully deficient arithmetic.) If I, er, comprehend it correctly, the latest draft of The Hours has it that you originally """"thought"""" five hours was """"about"""" two hours. Interesting.  And revealing. In fact you sniffily dismissed the interval as """"less than 2 hours"""" (my emph.). Interesting and revealing because? Because the open-ended """"about"""" tends to support a story of an innocent """"estimate"""".  But """"less than"""" doesn't. """"Less than"""" is specifically limited. Narrowed in focus, specific, it's more clearly a calculated (no pun intended) lie. It's well-known that most liars have trouble remembering which lie they told. Less well-known is the fact that their use of words, trivial though words seem to them, often gives them away. Freudian slips? Elementary, my dear Watson.

 Please use an edit summary when making edits.  This is useful for other editors to see at a glance what were the changes you made.
 Please use the Preview button (right beside the Save Page button) when making changes, so that you don't have to make numerous minor edits one right after another.  This keeps the history smaller and allows other editors to see more easily what changes you made.

About GUSAC
by G U S A C - Gitam University Science and Activity Centre on Tuesday, August 16, 2011 at 2:54pm ·
GITAM University Science and Activity Center
 
The GUSAC team is privileged to invite the students across the GITAM University.
After several untiring efforts we have been finally successful in launching a
Science and Activity Center at GITAM University.
 
 
MOTTO: 
 
 “ It’s not what you know, It’s what you do with what you know” .
 
     Our main objective is to integrate knowledge and transfer the same to students.GUSAC will provide an exclusive platform to the """"Budding Future"""" by nourishing their creativity. It will unleash the genius with in them and capacitate them to implement their ideas to the in numerous problems arising in the world.
 
     A fresher aims to attain his/her goals during his/her tenure in the university. GUSAC provides a scope for students like these by imparting knowledge through classes,friendly seminars, practical assignments....., it also enables them to build a team for participating in fests  and assists them with the required infrastructure to make their projects, besides creating a platform for the student research.
 
Benefits of GUSAC:
 
It creates an environment for interested students to evenly space out and implement their ideas.
Many students who have potential and are interested in participating in various events fail to do the same may be due to lack of proper inter-departmental knowledge and freedom to put forth their ideas. This center fill these gaps and provide better prospects for the students of GU.
Students will be exposed to national level competitions and are provided with a platform to put forth their projects and to gain recognition for their work.
Most of the projects aimed at will be targeted towards nation-building, to help the needy and the disabled.
Seeing the benefits of GUSAC, here is a tentative curriculum on how GUSAC moves forward:
 
GUSAC will  be administered in the following manner:
 
Step 1: All the students are free to enroll into GUSAC by giving names into database and will be accessible to weekend classes, friendly seminars and practical assignments.
Step 2: The students who are regular to the weekly classes with their active involvement towards GUSAC will be shifted to this step based on a small essay or a video on """"why should they be selected into step-2"""". In step 2 the student is free to access the GUSAC labs and to use the equipments as well.
Step 3: Eligible students of second year (sophomores) will be placed in a semi-core group and will contribute to the decision making process of GUSAC.
Step 4: Eligible students of third year (juniors) will be placed in sub-core and will have higher powers than semi-core.
Step 5: Eligible students of final year (seniors) will be in the core group. They will co-ordinate all the events of GUSAC and will play a crucial role in the decision making process of GUSAC.
 
The students will be given weekly assignments which will make them think out of the box and students who win will be awarded in an interesting way. The freshers can gain extra knowledge and make use of this to innovate projects using their time productively.
 
 
Stepping Stones to Success:
A student gathering will take place every week to discuss their interests and recent trends in Management, Science and Technology.
Students will work on their projects and ideas with freedom and utilities.
Experienced students will give lectures and problem statements will be given to students as practical assignments to keep enhancing their engineering skills.
Events like expos, seminars, fests and workshops will be conducted on a regular basis and representatives from the industry as well as academic circles  like IIT’s  will be invited to these events.
Faculty members who are interested in sharing their knowledge will always be welcome to do so in any of the aforementioned events and gatherings.
Students will be informed about the fests, events, industrial visits, internships to retain the practical approach of curriculum.
The center will be visiting schools nearby to have  chalk talks with the kids and also will give them a privilege to showcase their ideas. The interested one's will be called upon to the university to have a look at our projects and ideas.
 
If the chords of ingenuity have struck right, why not unearth the Einstein with in you???
 
@ GITAM STUDENTS  why late, get yourself enrolled in GUSAC and  scale heights in the world of emerging trends.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Wow, what cat and mouse games you are playing. My first sentence is fact. I might have used sarcasm in my reply to you, but that definitely doesn't compare to the incivility you have committed against me and whoever the other person was who got banned (I'm sorry, don't know who that is, just saw the aftermath).

You were asked about your mistake and a request was made by someone politely before me. Another request was made (again, no clue who it was) providing multiple pieces of evidence. All of this was dismissed, and one of the accounts was blocked as a sock puppet. Me being an organizer of the RHoK event heard there was something up with the Wikipedia page. I go and check, see it's """"Blatant Hoax"""". Of course I am offended, on my back (as well as many others) was this event created and ran and who are you to dispute the facts we presented. My last sentences weren't an attack, it was sarcasm towards the fact I would expect so much better of an admin with your credentials. """"Rogue Admin"""" means you take a critical eye towards """"hoax"""" among other things. So where was the critical eye here? Where was the actions in line with your status at all? From my point of view, here is the course of action:

 1) PMDrive1061 innocently deletes something he thought was a """"hoax"""" without actually looking into it.

 2) Several people come to his talk page and offer facts. The page is then recreated and quickly PMDrive1061 deletes the page and bans one of the users. No discussion, just totalitarian action.

 3) I come along see the aftermath that happens and get validly annoyed and angry. I state a long list of reliable irrefutable sources and make a sarcastic comment about the situation which was more than warranted.

 4) Now this admin is so pushed over the edge, he looses focus of the policies and rules he's here to defend and instead lashes out in every direction banning people at will

 5) Another editor comes in and helps diffuse the situation, who works with me to get the original sources provided into a restored story. I'm told the page is live and that blocks were removed.

 6) I then go to try to edit the page to add one more link and find I am still blocked. I come here, explain my case, then find I am yet again harassed by an admin who seriously doesn't grasp  that he's dived off the deepend and at this point should be asked to stop moderating and push away from the PC as he's lost focus of the real objectives.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Bharatiyaji,

What is your view on where Vedas, Mahabharata and the Ashtadhyayi were composed? Can you briefly mention your views and if possible give us some references, so that we can examine them?

It is the view of the prominent scholars that these were indeed composed in the Punjab region. When I say 'Punjab region' I don't necessarily mean the Indian state of Punjab, which is just a small part of former Punjab.

Internal evidence from these books leads us to the same conclusion that they they were indeed composed in this region.

The article Hinduism in Punjab is still evolving. However you can see a hint of the historical information that is avaialble to us. 

Let us work together to make these article more informative to all.

Please do let us know in some detail of what you are looking for, and what perceptions we need to address.

Berkshires,

Perhaps you say that you agree with the quoted statement, but you don't seem to get it.

Yes it is true that the Beth Din will not/didn't decide who is or should be a Rebbe to whom. They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the """"Bobover Rebbe"""", who can use the name Bobov.

Berkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.

Think for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.

There was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a """"mamshich"""" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a """"mamshich"""" of Sanzer Ruv.

Try to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.

Putting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.

If you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.

I went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.

In any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. Rabbi Unger can no longer refer to himself as Bobover Rebbe. 

It would be appropriate for you to give this a rest.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I addded the link to positivism, because the name of Auguste Comte is often associated to it. He is even said to be the founder of this philosophical movement. A Google search """"Auguste Comte positivism"""" returns more than 3,000 hits. For instance: http://www.erraticimpact.com/~19thcentury/html/comte.htm

This being said, I am not an expert, and would not be able to write anything interesting about this theory. I am not even sure if the Logical positivism to which positivism redirects at the moment is the same concept or if it has any connection with Comte's theory. Maybe there is a misuse in English of """"positivism"""" instead of """"positive philosophy"""", but his concept is definitely called """"positivisme"""" in French.

But since his retirement many new sources, in particular great numbers of Khmer inscriptions have become available. Hardly noticed, entire sections reviewed in the 70ies and 80ies, them replaced in turn in the 90ies and so on... However, as debate among historians progresses normally, archaeology and geo-dating getting more and more important, publishers of second and third grade resources stubbornly copy the (in some cases 60 years) old texts.",0,0,0,0,0,0

73b00735f920fe77,"The English Parliament had absolute power to make laws for the Province of Virginia, the inhabitants were subjects (there being no citizenship), courts sitting in England were able to issue prorogative writs, and in fact removed a governor on a writ of quo warranto, all laws passed by the House of Burgesses had to be approved by the Crown and all Virginia court judgments could be appealed to the Crown.  That prerogative writs could be sent to Britain's colonies was used in arguing for the right of habeas corpus in Guantanamo Bay.  Otherwise the English courts considered Virginia outside their jurisdiction and accepted the independence of local courts.  Obviously a country cannot possess another country unless it has executive, legislative and judicial power over it.  Would you say that the Virginia was a part of England?  Do you think that Bermuda, etc. are part of England today?  Or Canada for that matter until Britain ceded its power to legislate in 1982?",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ok. Sure, Russia bombed Gori. I'm not disputing that. I was talking about Tshinvali.

I'm an agnostic Canadian. I'm not aware of anyone in this country using BCE/CE.
No other language that I read regularly or occasionally is using an equivalent for BCE/CE.
I personally find it obnoxious and pushy, especially in the context of this article.
Changing """"Christ"""" into """"Common"""". Wow, if there is an historical figure who would not be described as common and ordinary, we certainly have one here. Jesus, that is in bad taste.
BC/AD. I vote for this exclusively.
